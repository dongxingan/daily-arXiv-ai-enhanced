Most modern data-driven methods require\nlarge datasets and struggle with real-time updates of models, limiting their\nperformance in dynamic environments. Koopman theory formally represents\nnonlinear systems as linear models over observables, and Koopman\nrepresentations can be determined from data in an optimization-friendly setting\nwith potentially rapid model updates. In this paper, we present a highly\nsample-efficient, Koopman-based learning pipeline: Recursive Koopman Learning\n(RKL). We identify sufficient conditions for model convergence and provide\nformal algorithmic analysis supporting our claim that RKL is lightweight and\nfast, with complexity independent of dataset size. We validate our method on a\nsimulated planar two-link arm and a hybrid nonlinear hardware system with soft\nactuators, showing that real-time recursive Koopman model updates improve the\nsample efficiency and stability of data-driven controller synthesis --\nrequiring only <10% of the data compared to benchmarks.

It builds on the 3D foundation model MASt3R to extract pointmaps\nfrom RGB images, which are combined with robot poses to reconstruct a scaled 3D\nscene aligned with the robot. Experiments on diverse datasets show that Calib3R\nachieves accurate calibration with less than 10 images, outperforming\ntarget-less and marker-based methods."}

Chemical\nexperiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable\nsubstances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict\ncompliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose\n\\textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based\nsystems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with\ntransparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack\nsemantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve\nas (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt\ngenerator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and\nregulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts\nimage-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned\ncontrol. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete\nmulti-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate\nand a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA\nbaselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks."}
