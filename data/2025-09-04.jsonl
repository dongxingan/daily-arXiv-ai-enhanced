Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment\nassumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic\nSLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic\nfeatures, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point\nfeatures for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by\ncontinuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point\nfeatures, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current\nmethods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity,\ncausing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential\nperformance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and\nnoise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism\nthat evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line\nfeature support should be activated.

This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data."}

We compare two distinct robot\ncontrol paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base\nnavigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as\nseparate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback\nmechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based\nvisualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were\nsystematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring\nintegrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a\nfeedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and\nperceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation\nleads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while\npreliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation\nleads to better imitation learning performance. Our holistic view on intuitive\nteleoperation interfaces provides valuable insight into collecting\nhigh-quality, high-dimensional mobile manipulation data at scale with the human\noperator in mind.

This\nstudy presents a method to examine their persuasive capabilities. We designed\nan experimental framework focused on decision making and tested it in a pilot\nthat varied robot appearance and self-knowledge. Using qualitative analysis, we\nevaluated interaction quality, persuasion effectiveness, and the robot's\ncommunicative strategies. Participants generally experienced the interaction\npositively, describing the robot as competent, friendly, and supportive, while\nnoting practical limits such as delayed responses and occasional\nspeech-recognition errors. Persuasiveness was highly context dependent and\nshaped by robot behavior: participants responded well to polite, reasoned\nsuggestions and expressive gestures, but emphasized the need for more\npersonalized, context-aware arguments and clearer social roles. These findings\nsuggest that generative social robots can influence user decisions, but their\neffectiveness depends on communicative nuance and contextual relevance. We\npropose refinements to the framework to further study persuasive dynamics\nbetween robots and human users."}

The\ninstallation features an array of belts suspended from the ceiling, each\nactuated by stepper motors and dynamically oriented by a vision-based tracking\nsystem that follows the movements of exhibition visitors. The original system\nwas limited by oscillatory dynamics, resulting in torsional and pendulum-like\nvibrations that constrained rotational speed and reduced interactive\nresponsiveness. To address these challenges, the refurbishment involved\nsignificant upgrades to both hardware and motion control algorithms. A detailed\nmathematical model of the flying belt system was developed to accurately\ncapture its dynamic behavior, providing a foundation for advanced control\ndesign. An input shaping method, formulated as a convex optimization problem,\nwas implemented to effectively suppress vibrations, enabling smoother and\nfaster belt movements. Experimental results demonstrate substantial\nimprovements in system performance and audience interaction. This work\nexemplifies the integration of robotics, control engineering, and interactive\nart, offering new solutions to technical challenges in real-time motion control\nand vibration damping for large-scale kinetic installations."}

For example, constraints can be\nused for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision\navoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive\nControl, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints, relying on\nnumerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is\nchallenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make\ncontrollers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In\nour previous work, we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the\nsafe-set constraint recede along the MPC horizon. In this paper, we push that\nidea further by exploiting parallel computation to improve safety. We solve\nseveral MPC problems at the same time, where each problem instantiates the\nsafe-set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the\ncontroller can select the best solution according to some user-defined\ncriteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint\nrobotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved in terms of\nsafety and performance, even using as little as 4 computational cores."}

A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories", "comment": null, "summary": "The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for\ndata-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its\nvalidity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary\npost-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of\ntrajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data."}
