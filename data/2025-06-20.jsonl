However, its applicability in real-time, highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands. This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency operation suitable for complex robotic systems."}

We propose an efficient first-order method, Augmented Lagrangian Spectral Projected Gradient Descent (ALSPG), which leverages geometric projections via Euclidean projections, Minkowski sums, and basis functions. We show that by using geometric constraints rather than full constraints and gradients, ALSPG significantly improves real-time performance.

We validate our method through toy examples and extensive simulations, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a 7-axis Franka robot, a 6-axis P-Rob robot and a 1:10 scale car in real-world experiments.

However, in-home meal assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g., eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV), food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii) diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences, and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each across three diverse scenarios.

Achieving autonomous operation requires systems to navigate safely through complex and unfamiliar environments. This level of autonomy is particularly challenging due to the complexity of such environments and the need for real-time decision making especially for platforms constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP), which limits flight time and precludes the use of bulky sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for mapping. Furthermore, computing globally optimal, collision-free paths and translating them into time-optimized, safe trajectories in real time adds significant computational complexity. To address these challenges, we present a fully onboard, real-time navigation system that relies solely on lightweight onboard sensors. Our system constructs a dense 3D map of the environment using a novel visual depth estimation approach that fuses stereo and monocular learning-based depth, yielding longer-range, denser, and less noisy depth maps than conventional stereo methods. Building on this map, we introduce a novel planning and trajectory generation framework capable of rapidly computing time-optimal global trajectories. As the map is incrementally updated with new depth information, our system continuously refines the trajectory to maintain safety and optimality. Both our planner and trajectory generator outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and guarantee obstacle-free trajectories. We validate our system through robust autonomous flight experiments in diverse indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for safe navigation in previously unknown settings."}

Additionally, the dexterity of human fingers should be exploited for more engaged interaction. In this work, we propose an aerial teleoperation system that brings the omnidirectionality of human hands into the unbounded aerial workspace. Our system includes two motion-tracking marker sets -- one on the shoulder and one on the hand -- along with a data glove to capture hand gestures. Using these inputs, we design four interaction modes for different tasks, including Spherical Mode and Cartesian Mode for long-range moving as well as Operation Mode and Locking Mode for precise manipulation, where the hand gestures are utilized for seamless mode switching. We evaluate our system on a valve-turning task in real world, demonstrating how each mode contributes to effective aerial manipulation. This interaction framework bridges human dexterity with aerial robotics, paving the way for enhanced teleoperated aerial manipulation in unstructured environments."}

Traditional methods typically treat each new context as a separate task with its own reward function. For example, if a previously ignored stove becomes too hot to be around, the robot must learn a new reward from scratch, even though the underlying preference for prioritizing safety over efficiency remains unchanged. We observe that context influences not the underlying preference itself, but rather the $\\textit{saliency}$--or importance--of reward features. For instance, stove heat affects the importance of the robot's proximity, yet the human's safety preference stays the same. Existing multi-task and meta IRL methods learn context-dependent representations $\\textit{implicitly}$--without distinguishing between preferences and feature importance--resulting in substantial data requirements. Instead, we propose $\\textit{explicitly}$ modeling context-invariant preferences separately from context-dependent feature saliency, creating modular reward representations that adapt to new contexts. To achieve this, we introduce $\\textit{calibrated features}$--representations that capture contextual effects on feature saliency--and present specialized paired comparison queries that isolate saliency from preference for efficient learning. Experiments with simulated users show our method significantly improves sample efficiency, requiring 10x fewer preference queries than baselines to achieve equivalent reward accuracy, with up to 15% better performance in low-data regimes (5-10 queries). An in-person user study (N=12) demonstrates that participants can effectively teach their unique personal contextual preferences using our method, enabling more adaptable and personalized reward learning."}

The key contribution is a novel task allocation framework that incorporates the consideration of physical constraints introduced by multitasking. This is in contrast to the existing work where such constraints are largely ignored. After formulating the problem, we propose a compilation to weighted MAX-SAT, which allows us to leverage existing solvers for a solution. A more efficient greedy heuristic is then introduced. For evaluation, we first compare our methods with a modern baseline that is efficient for single-tasking robots to validate the benefits of multitasking in synthetic domains. Then, using a site-clearing scenario in simulation, we further illustrate the complex task interaction considered by the multitasking robots in our approach to demonstrate its performance. Finally, we demonstrate a physical experiment to show how multitasking enabled by our approach can benefit task efficiency in a realistic setting."}

Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1. We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax (short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an \"L2 clarity mode\" for Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these challenging tense/lax minimal pairs."}

Recently, a variant of IL, called In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

However, in complex environments, the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable, particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21% improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter."}

It emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies -- creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations, the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift towards self-defending robotic systems. This research not only underscores the importance of offensive measures in enhancing robot cybersecurity but also sets the stage for future advancements where robots are not just resilient to cyber threats but are equipped to autonomously safeguard themselves."}

This paper investigates coverage path planning strategies to enhance the efficiency of underwater gliders, particularly in maximizing the probability of detecting a radioactive source while ensuring safe navigation.\n  We evaluate three path-planning approaches: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Optimal Control Problem (OCP). Simulations were conducted in MATLAB, comparing processing time, uncovered areas, path length, and traversal time. Results indicate that OCP is preferable when traversal time is constrained, although it incurs significantly higher computational costs. Conversely, MST-based approaches provide faster but less optimal solutions. These findings offer insights into selecting appropriate algorithms based on mission priorities, balancing efficiency and computational feasibility."}

Supplementary Video: https://youtu.be/sZ8_z7sYVP0", "summary": "We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for efficient Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) using a mobile manipulator. Our approach combines interaction-based obstacle property estimation with structured pushing strategies, facilitating the dynamic manipulation of unforeseen obstacles while adhering to a pre-planned global path. The high-level policy generates pushing commands that consider environmental constraints and path-tracking objectives, while the low-level policy precisely and stably executes these commands through coordinated whole-body movements. Comprehensive simulation-based experiments demonstrate improvements in performing NAMO tasks, including higher success rates, shortened traversed path length, and reduced goal-reaching times, compared to baselines. Additionally, ablation studies assess the efficacy of each component, while a qualitative analysis further validates the accuracy and reliability of the real-time obstacle property estimation."}

However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent, and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity."}

In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal surfing aquatic-aerial vehicle, SurfAAV, which efficiently integrates underwater navigation, surface gliding, and aerial flying capabilities. Thanks to the design of the novel differential thrust vectoring hydrofoil, SurfAAV can achieve efficient surface gliding and underwater navigation without the need for a buoyancy adjustment system. This design provides flexible operational capabilities for both surface and underwater tasks, enabling the robot to quickly carry out underwater monitoring activities. Additionally, when it is necessary to reach another water body, SurfAAV can switch to aerial mode through a gliding takeoff, flying to the target water area to perform corresponding tasks. The main contribution of this letter lies in proposing a new solution for underwater, surface, and aerial movement, designing a novel hybrid prototype concept, developing the required control laws, and validating the robot's ability to successfully perform surface gliding and gliding takeoff. SurfAAV achieves a maximum surface gliding speed of 7.96 m/s and a maximum underwater speed of 3.1 m/s. The prototype's surface gliding maneuverability and underwater cruising maneuverability both exceed those of existing aquatic-aerial vehicles."}

The method is designed for localization solutions where UWB modules act as supplementary sensors. Our approach enables the automatic detection and calibration of previously unknown anchors during operation, removing the need for manual setup. By combining an online Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP) estimation, a lightweight outlier detection method, and an adaptive robust kernel for non-linear optimization, our approach significantly improves robustness and suitability for real-world applications compared to state-of-the-art. In particular, we show that our metric which triggers an initialization decision is more conservative than current ones commonly based on initial linear or non-linear initialization guesses. This allows for better initialization geometry and subsequently lower initialization errors. We demonstrate the proposed approach on two different mobile robots: an autonomous forklift and a quadcopter equipped with a UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) framework. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method with robust initialization and low positioning error. We open-source our code in a C++ library including a ROS wrapper."}

We formulate an optimization problem to optimize the aerial manipulator's trajectory, incorporating task constraints to achieve efficient manipulation. To address the challenge of incorporating the delta arm's non-convex workspace into optimization constraints, we leverage a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to map position points to feasibility probabilities.Furthermore, we employ Reversible Residual Networks (RevNet) to approximate the complex forward kinematics of the delta arm, utilizing efficient model gradients to eliminate workspace constraints. We validate our methods in simulations and real-world experiments to demonstrate their effectiveness."}

To address these challenges, we introduce GRIM (Grasp Re-alignment via Iterative Matching), a novel training-free framework for task-oriented grasping. Initially, a coarse alignment strategy is developed using a combination of geometric cues and principal component analysis (PCA)-reduced DINO features for similarity scoring. Subsequently, the full grasp pose associated with the retrieved memory instance is transferred to the aligned scene object and further refined against a set of task-agnostic, geometrically stable grasps generated for the scene object, prioritizing task compatibility. In contrast to existing learning-based methods, GRIM demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, achieving robust performance with only a small number of conditioning examples."}

On the hardware side, ViA employs a simple yet effective 6-DoF robotic neck to enable flexible, human-like head movements. To capture human active perception strategies, we design a VR-based teleoperation interface that creates a shared observation space between the robot and the human operator. To mitigate VR motion sickness caused by latency in the robot's physical movements, the interface uses an intermediate 3D scene representation, enabling real-time view rendering on the operator side while asynchronously updating the scene with the robot's latest observations. Together, these design elements enable the learning of robust visuomotor policies for three complex, multi-stage bimanual manipulation tasks involving visual occlusions, significantly outperforming baseline systems."}

We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views.
