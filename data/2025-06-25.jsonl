While the simplicity and\nversatility of parallel grippers have led to widespread adoption, these\ngrippers are limited by their heavy reliance on visual feedback. Tactile\nsensing and soft robotics can add responsiveness and compliance. However,\nexisting methods typically involve high integration complexity or suffer from\nslow response times. In this work, we introduce FORTE, a tactile sensing system\nembedded in compliant gripper fingers. FORTE uses 3D-printed fin-ray grippers\nwith internal air channels to provide low-latency force and slip feedback.\nFORTE applies just enough force to grasp objects without damaging them, while\nremaining easy to fabricate and integrate. We find that FORTE can accurately\nestimate grasping forces from 0-8 N with an average error of 0.2 N, and detect\nslip events within 100 ms of occurring. We demonstrate FORTE's ability to grasp\na wide range of slippery, fragile, and deformable objects. In particular, FORTE\ngrasps fragile objects like raspberries and potato chips with a 98.6% success\nrate, and achieves 93% accuracy in detecting slip events.

In affective computing, the role of haptic feedback within dynamic\nemotional exchanges remains underexplored. This study investigates how\nsituational emotional cues influence the perception and interpretation of\nhaptic signals given by a robot. In a controlled experiment, 32 participants\nwatched video scenarios in which a robot experienced either positive actions\n(such as being kissed), negative actions (such as being slapped) or neutral\nactions. After each video, the robot conveyed its emotional response through\nhaptic communication, delivered via a wearable vibration sleeve worn by the\nparticipant. Participants rated the robot's emotional state-its valence\n(positive or negative) and arousal (intensity)-based on the video, the haptic\nfeedback, and the combination of the two. The study reveals a dynamic interplay\nbetween visual context and touch. Participants' interpretation of haptic\nfeedback was strongly shaped by the emotional context of the video, with visual\ncontext often overriding the perceived valence of the haptic signal. Negative\nhaptic cues amplified the perceived valence of the interaction, while positive\ncues softened it. Furthermore, haptics override the participants' perception of\narousal of the video. Together, these results offer insights into how situated\nhaptic feedback can enrich affective human-robot interaction, pointing toward\nmore nuanced and embodied approaches to emotional communication with machines."}

How much control do users, in fact, want over\nthe actions of robots used for in-home assistance? We investigate how robot\nautonomy levels affect users' sense of agency and the autonomy level they\nprefer in contexts with varying risks. Our study asked participants to rate\ntheir sense of agency as robot users across four distinct autonomy levels and\nranked their robot preferences with respect to various household tasks. Our\nfindings revealed that participants' sense of agency was primarily influenced\nby two factors: (1) whether the robot acts autonomously, and (2) whether a\nthird party is involved in the robot's programming or operation.

While reinforcement learning (RL) can\nalleviate the data bottleneck by generating experience in simulation, it\ntypically relies on carefully designed, task-specific reward functions, which\nhinder scalability and generalization. Thus, contemporary works in dexterous\nmanipulation have often bootstrapped from reference trajectories. These\ntrajectories specify target hand poses that guide the exploration of RL\npolicies and object poses that enable dense, task-agnostic rewards. However,\nsourcing suitable trajectories - particularly for dexterous hands - remains a\nsignificant challenge. Yet, the precise details in explicit reference\ntrajectories are often unnecessary, as RL ultimately refines the motion. Our\nkey insight is that modern vision-language models (VLMs) already encode the\ncommonsense spatial and semantic knowledge needed to specify tasks and guide\nexploration effectively. Given a task description (e.g., \"open the cabinet\")\nand a visual scene, our method uses an off-the-shelf VLM to first identify\ntask-relevant keypoints (e.g., handles, buttons) and then synthesize 3D\ntrajectories for hand motion and object motion. Subsequently, we train a\nlow-level residual RL policy in simulation to track these coarse trajectories\nor \"scaffolds\" with high fidelity. Across a number of simulated tasks involving\narticulated objects and semantic understanding, we demonstrate that our method\nis able to learn robust dexterous manipulation policies.

Among these\nbenefits, adaptability is particularly noteworthy. In this paper, adaptability\nin soft robots is categorized into external and internal adaptability. External\nadaptability refers to the robot's ability to adjust, either passively or\nactively, to variations in environments, object properties, geometries, and\ntask dynamics. Internal adaptability refers to the robot's ability to cope with\ninternal variations, such as manufacturing tolerances or material aging, and to\ngeneralize control strategies across different robots. As the field of soft\nrobotics continues to evolve, the significance of adaptability has become\nincreasingly pronounced. In this review, we summarize various approaches to\nenhancing the adaptability of soft robots, including design, sensing, and\ncontrol strategies. Additionally, we assess the impact of adaptability on\napplications such as surgery, wearable devices, locomotion, and manipulation.\nWe also discuss the limitations of soft robotics adaptability and prospective\ndirections for future research. By analyzing adaptability through the lenses of\nimplementation, application, and challenges, this paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive understanding of this essential characteristic in soft robotics\nand its implications for diverse applications."}

Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic manipulation\ntasks, primarily due to the extensive world knowledge they gain from\nlarge-scale datasets. In this process, Spatial Representations (such as points\nrepresenting object positions or vectors representing object orientations) act\nas a bridge between VLMs and real-world scene, effectively grounding the\nreasoning abilities of VLMs and applying them to specific task scenarios.\nHowever, existing VLM-based robotic approaches often adopt a fixed spatial\nrepresentation extraction scheme for various tasks, resulting in insufficient\nrepresentational capability or excessive extraction time. In this work, we\nintroduce T-Rex, a Task-Adaptive Framework for Spatial Representation\nExtraction, which dynamically selects the most appropriate spatial\nrepresentation extraction scheme for each entity based on specific task\nrequirements.

Recently, many methods for\ncross-sensor transfer between optical (vision-based) tactile sensors have been\ninvestigated, yet little work focus on non-optical tactile sensors. To address\nthis gap, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture to unify tactile data\nacross non-vision-based sensors. By leveraging sensor-specific encoders, the\nframework creates a latent space that is sensor-agnostic, enabling cross-sensor\ndata transfer with low errors and direct use in downstream applications. We\nleverage this network to unify tactile data from two commercial tactile\nsensors: the Xela uSkin uSPa 46 and the Contactile PapillArray. Both were\nmounted on a UR5e robotic arm, performing force-controlled pressing sequences\nagainst distinct object shapes (circular, square, and hexagonal prisms) and two\nmaterials (rigid PLA and flexible TPU). Another more complex unseen object was\nalso included to investigate the model's generalization capabilities. We show\nthat alignment in latent space can be implicitly learned from joint autoencoder\ntraining with matching contacts collected via different sensors. We further\ndemonstrate the practical utility of our approach through contact geometry\nestimation, where downstream models trained on one sensor's latent\nrepresentation can be directly applied to another without retraining."}

CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame\npretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens\nprediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)\nmulti-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from\ndiscrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating\nmotion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame\ndecoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared\ndecoder with cross-attention.
