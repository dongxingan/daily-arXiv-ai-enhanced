TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于4通道双边控制的低成本机械臂快速遥操作方法，解决了传统单边控制缺乏力反馈的问题，并通过实验验证了该方法在模仿学习中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低成本机械臂在遥操作中缺乏力反馈，难以实现快速或接触丰富的任务。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用4通道双边控制，结合非线性补偿、速度和外力估计以及惯性变化的可变增益，实现力反馈遥操作。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在快速遥操作和模仿学习中表现优异，提升了任务性能。

Conclusion: 4通道双边控制为低成本机械臂提供了高保真度的遥操作和数据收集解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased
interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data.
However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits
target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable
for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations
due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast
teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless,
low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on
accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear
terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain
corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by
4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into
both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation
learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for
high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

TL;DR: 论文通过扩展Diffusion Policy范式，评估了多任务机器人操作策略（LBMs），并提出了严格的评估流程。结果表明，多任务预训练提高了策略的成功率和鲁棒性，且能更快地教授复杂新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人操作领域虽取得进展，但对大规模机器人基础模型的真实性能评估仍不足，限制了发展和对现有能力的理解。

Method: 扩展Diffusion Policy范式，评估多任务机器人操作策略（LBMs），提出并验证评估流程，通过模拟和真实实验对比单任务基线。

Result: 多任务预训练使策略更成功、鲁棒，且能更快教授复杂新任务，数据需求仅为单任务基线的一小部分。性能随预训练规模和多样性增加而提升。

Conclusion: 多任务预训练在机器人操作中具有显著优势，为未来大规模机器人基础模型的发展提供了方向。

Abstract: Robot manipulation has seen tremendous progress in recent years, with
imitation learning policies enabling successful performance of dexterous and
hard-to-model tasks. Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the
development of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating
large-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While
these models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful
evaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the
pace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current
capabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot
manipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by
extending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and
real-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to
rigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical
confidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized
trials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world
experiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more
successful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly,
using a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover,
performance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决海洋机器人中的立体声学数据融合问题，提高特征对应和3D信息恢复的能力。

Method: 受立体相机极线几何启发，提出声学几何方法，利用相对位姿信息将特征从一个声纳图像投影到另一个声纳图像。

Result: 通过仿真结果，确定了适用于野外机器人应用（如特征对应和3D信息恢复）的理想立体配置。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨模态立体声纳系统提供了一种有效的几何解决方案，适用于海洋机器人应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we address stereo acoustic data fusion for marine robotics and
propose a geometry-based method for projecting observed features from one sonar
to another for a cross-modal stereo sonar setup that consists of both a
forward-looking and a sidescan sonar. Our acoustic geometry for sidescan and
forward-looking sonar is inspired by the epipolar geometry for stereo cameras,
and we leverage relative pose information to project where an observed feature
in one sonar image will be found in the image of another sonar. Additionally,
we analyze how both the feature location relative to the sonar and the relative
pose between the two sonars impact the projection. From simulated results, we
identify desirable stereo configurations for applications in field robotics
like feature correspondence and recovery of the 3D information of the feature.

### [4] [CRED: Counterfactual Reasoning and Environment Design for Active Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05458)
*Yi-Shiuan Tung,Bradley Hayes,Alessandro Roncone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CRED是一种用于主动偏好学习（APL）的轨迹生成方法，通过联合优化环境设计和轨迹选择，提升奖励估计效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需适应人类偏好（如距离、时间和安全的平衡），但现有APL方法在长时任务中难以探索完整轨迹空间或生成信息丰富的查询。

Method: CRED通过环境设计“想象”新场景，并利用反事实推理生成多样且信息丰富的轨迹用于排序。

Result: 在GridWorld和真实导航任务中，CRED提升了奖励学习效果，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CRED通过创新的轨迹生成方法，显著改进了APL在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: For effective real-world deployment, robots should adapt to human
preferences, such as balancing distance, time, and safety in delivery routing.
Active preference learning (APL) learns human reward functions by presenting
trajectories for ranking. However, existing methods often struggle to explore
the full trajectory space and fail to identify informative queries,
particularly in long-horizon tasks. We propose CRED, a trajectory generation
method for APL that improves reward estimation by jointly optimizing
environment design and trajectory selection. CRED "imagines" new scenarios
through environment design and uses counterfactual reasoning -- by sampling
rewards from its current belief and asking "What if this reward were the true
preference?" -- to generate a diverse and informative set of trajectories for
ranking. Experiments in GridWorld and real-world navigation using OpenStreetMap
data show that CRED improves reward learning and generalizes effectively across
different environments.

### [5] [Gaussian Process-Based Active Exploration Strategies in Vision and Touch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05522)
*Ho Jin Choi,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合视觉与触觉的GPDF方法，用于机器人主动感知物体属性，无需大规模预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人因缺乏先验知识难以理解物体属性，而人类通过多感官交互学习。

Method: 结合视觉与触觉数据构建GPDF表示，利用点云、梯度和不确定性估计优化几何模型。

Result: 通过实验验证了GPDF在精确3D结构重建和表面属性建模上的潜力。

Conclusion: GPDF为机器人主动探索复杂物体几何提供了有效方法，并具有扩展潜力。

Abstract: Robots struggle to understand object properties like shape, material, and
semantics due to limited prior knowledge, hindering manipulation in
unstructured environments. In contrast, humans learn these properties through
interactive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and
tactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)
representation for active perception of object properties. While primarily
focusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling
surface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using
point cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,
which are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By
utilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need
extensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by
aggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework
iteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using
differentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.
By quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to
maximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the
real-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot
manipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile
sensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector. In
these experiments, the robot explores the shape and properties of objects
assumed to be static and placed on the table. To improve scalability, we
investigate approximation methods like inducing point method for Gaussian
Processes. This probabilistic multi-modal fusion enables active exploration and
mapping of complex object geometries, extending potentially beyond geometry.

Abstract: We introduce PAPRLE (Plug-And-Play Robotic Limb Environment), a modular
ecosystem that enables flexible placement and control of robotic limbs. With
PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control
them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming
controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of
teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task
requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable
puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target
robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these
puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot.
By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides
real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction
awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements
of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research
in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various
real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations
of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open
source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader
adoption and community-driven extension. Additional resources and

### [7] [Structured Task Solving via Modular Embodied Intelligence: A Case Study on Rubik's Cube](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05607)
*Chongshan Fan,Shenghai Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Auto-RubikAI是一个模块化自主规划框架，结合知识库、视觉语言模型和大语言模型，以最小数据需求解决结构化操作任务（如魔方还原）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人系统依赖预定义脚本或大规模演示数据，Auto-RubikAI旨在实现可解释的多步任务执行，减少数据依赖。

Method: 系统通过知识库模块解决符号推理问题，视觉语言模型解析RGB-D输入构建3D场景，大语言模型生成控制代码。

Result: 实验显示79%的任务成功率，相比基线方法减少步骤数并保持可解释性。

Conclusion: Auto-RubikAI为智能制造和机器人教育提供了高效、模块化的任务规划基础。

Abstract: This paper presents Auto-RubikAI, a modular autonomous planning framework
that integrates a symbolic Knowledge Base (KB), a vision-language model (VLM),
and a large language model (LLM) to solve structured manipulation tasks
exemplified by Rubik's Cube restoration. Unlike traditional robot systems based
on predefined scripts, or modern approaches relying on pretrained networks and
large-scale demonstration data, Auto-RubikAI enables interpretable, multi-step
task execution with minimal data requirements and no prior demonstrations. The
proposed system employs a KB module to solve group-theoretic restoration steps,
overcoming LLMs' limitations in symbolic reasoning. A VLM parses RGB-D input to
construct a semantic 3D scene representation, while the LLM generates
structured robotic control code via prompt chaining. This tri-module
architecture enables robust performance under spatial uncertainty. We deploy
Auto-RubikAI in both simulation and real-world settings using a 7-DOF robotic
arm, demonstrating effective Sim-to-Real adaptation without retraining.
Experiments show a 79% end-to-end task success rate across randomized
configurations. Compared to CFOP, DeepCubeA, and Two-Phase baselines, our
KB-enhanced method reduces average solution steps while maintaining
interpretability and safety. Auto-RubikAI provides a cost-efficient, modular
foundation for embodied task planning in smart manufacturing, robotics
education, and autonomous execution scenarios. Code, prompts, and hardware
modules will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamGrasp利用预训练图像生成模型的想象力推断场景未观察部分，结合3D重建和对比学习，实现复杂环境中的鲁棒3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏RGB图像下部分视图3D识别的挑战，特别是在遮挡和杂乱的真实场景中。

Method: 结合粗粒度3D重建、对比学习的实例分割和文本引导的实例级细化。

Result: 实验表明DreamGrasp能准确恢复物体几何，并支持下游任务如顺序清理和目标检索。

Conclusion: DreamGrasp在复杂多对象环境中表现出色，超越了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying
object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally
challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded
real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often
unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or
supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios.
In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the
imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to
infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction,
instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise
refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables
robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments
show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also
supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval
with high success rates.

TL;DR: Chrono::CRM是一种基于物理的通用、可扩展且高效的模拟解决方案，用于解决地面力学问题，支持复杂任务如挖掘、平地以及与可变形车轮的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越半经验地面力学方法（如Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto），提供基于物理的模型，以处理更复杂的任务。

Method: 基于Chrono的SPH框架，支持与刚性和柔性工具的交互，并通过GPU加速实现高效计算。

Result: 验证了与实验数据的一致性，包括NASA的MGRU3 rover测试，并与DEM模拟进行了对比。计算效率接近半经验方法，支持大规模地形模拟。

Conclusion: Chrono::CRM是一种开源、高效的模拟工具，适用于大规模地面力学问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper discusses Chrono's Continuous Representation Model (called herein
Chrono::CRM), a general-purpose, scalable, and efficient simulation solution
for terramechanics problems. Built on Chrono's Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) framework, Chrono::CRM moves beyond semi-empirical terramechanics
approaches, e.g., Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto, to provide a physics-based model
able to address complex tasks such as digging, grading, as well as interaction
with deformable wheels and complex grouser/lug patterns. The terramechanics
model is versatile in that it allows the terrain to interact with both rigid
and flexible implements simulated via the Chrono dynamics engine. We validate
Chrono::CRM against experimental data from three physical tests, including one
involving NASA's MGRU3 rover. In addition, the simulator is benchmarked against
a high-fidelity Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation of a digging scenario
involving the Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR).
Being GPU-accelerated, Chrono::CRM achieves computational efficiency comparable
to that of semi-empirical simulation approaches for terramechanics problems.
Through an ``active domains'' implementation, Chrono::CRM can handle terrain
stretches up to 10 km long with 100 million SPH particles at near interactive
rates, making high-fidelity off-road simulations at large scales feasible. As a
component of the Chrono package, the CRM model is open source and released
under a BSD-3 license. All models and simulations used in this contribution are
available in a public GitHub repository for reproducibility studies and further
research.

### [10] [3DGS_LSR:Large_Scale Relocation for Autonomous Driving Based on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05661)
*Haitao Lu,Haijier Chen,Haoze Liu,Shoujian Zhang,Bo Xu,Ziao Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 3DGS-LSR是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的大规模重定位框架，仅需单目RGB图像即可实现厘米级定位，适用于复杂城市环境中的自主机器人导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂城市环境中GNSS定位不可靠以及传统地图方法存储和计算效率低的问题。

Method: 结合多传感器数据构建高精度3DGS地图，使用SuperPoint和SuperGlue进行特征提取与匹配，并通过迭代优化策略逐步优化定位结果。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，3DGS-LSR在城镇道路、林荫大道和交通密集高速公路上的平均定位精度分别为0.026m、0.029m和0.081m，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 3DGS-LSR为自主机器人在GNSS失效的复杂城市环境中提供了可靠的定位能力。

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for
safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often
suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable
absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage
requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to
resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose
3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single
monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to
construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side
localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and
SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an
iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through
step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.
Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves
average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,
boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly
outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB
input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization
capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

*Neelay Joglekar,Fei Liu,Florian Richter,Michael C. Yip*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种稳定的跟踪闭环控制器，用于解决RCM机械臂在不可见部分的运动控制问题，并通过双层控制方案验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RCM机械臂在微创手术中至关重要，但现有系统存在关节读数误差，影响控制精度，尤其是不可见部分的误差无法通过视觉校正。

Method: 设计了一种可证明稳定的跟踪闭环控制器，并将其集成到双层控制方案中，用于整个运动链。

Result: 在仿真和实际环境中验证了方法的有效性，为从远程操作到自主手术的过渡提供了关键见解。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了RCM机械臂在不可见部分控制稳定性的空白，为未来自主手术的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Remote Center of Motion (RCM) robotic manipulators have revolutionized
Minimally Invasive Surgery, enabling precise, dexterous surgical manipulation
within the patient's body cavity without disturbing the insertion point on the
patient. Accurate RCM tool control is vital for incorporating autonomous
subtasks like suturing, blood suction, and tumor resection into robotic
surgical procedures, reducing surgeon fatigue and improving patient outcomes.
However, these cable-driven systems are subject to significant joint reading
errors, corrupting the kinematics computation necessary to perform control.
Although visual tracking with endoscopic cameras can correct errors on in-view
joints, errors in the kinematic chain prior to the insertion point are
irreparable because they remain out of view. No prior work has characterized
the stability of control under these conditions. We fill this gap by designing
a provably stable tracking-in-the-loop controller for the out-of-view portion
of the RCM manipulator kinematic chain. We additionally incorporate this
controller into a bilevel control scheme for the full kinematic chain. We
rigorously benchmark our method in simulated and real world settings to verify
our theoretical findings. Our work provides key insights into the next steps
required for the transition from teleoperated to autonomous surgery.

Conclusion: DMLoco展示了扩散模型在足式运动中的潜力，结合预训练和微调，实现了语言条件控制和稳定任务转换。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the powerful capabilities of imitation
learning in robotics. Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion
models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task
generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency.
While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in
legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding
errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited
data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in
legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address
these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework
for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO
finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions.
Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using
diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then,
it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task
transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion
Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized
deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient
solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained
robotic platforms.

TL;DR: hPGA-DP是一种结合了投影几何代数（PGA）的扩散策略方法，通过几何归纳偏置提升机器人学习中的训练效率和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在机器人学习中需要反复学习基础空间表示，导致冗余。通过引入几何归纳偏置可以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出hPGA-DP，结合PGA框架和P-GATr，采用混合架构（U-Net或Transformer）进行去噪。

Result: 实验表明hPGA-DP提升了任务性能和训练效率，并实现更快收敛。

Conclusion: hPGA-DP通过几何偏置和混合架构显著优化了扩散策略的效果。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to
their reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these
policies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones,
conditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a
robotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations
and operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to
ground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating
geometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this
redundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical
framework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric
inductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it
provides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric
primitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks
to reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable
operations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that
incorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging
its E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts
a hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action
decoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising
process. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task
performance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but
also achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model
compared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分布鲁棒优化（DRO）和证据深度学习（EDL）的框架，用于解决自动驾驶中感知不确定性的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖神经网络感知，但基于其推理结果的控制决策存在安全风险，需解决感知不确定性带来的挑战。

Method: 结合DRO和EDL，提出动态调整保守性的模糊集，并将其整合到模型预测控制（MPC）中，形成DRO-EDL-MPC算法。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中验证，该方法在高感知置信度下保持效率，在低置信度下强制执行保守约束。

Conclusion: DRO-EDL-MPC框架有效平衡了自动驾驶中的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Safety is a critical concern in motion planning for autonomous vehicles.
Modern autonomous vehicles rely on neural network-based perception, but making
control decisions based on these inference results poses significant safety
risks due to inherent uncertainties. To address this challenge, we present a
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that accounts for both
aleatoric and epistemic perception uncertainties using evidential deep learning
(EDL). Our approach introduces a novel ambiguity set formulation based on
evidential distributions that dynamically adjusts the conservativeness
according to perception confidence levels. We integrate this uncertainty-aware
constraint into model predictive control (MPC), proposing the DRO-EDL-MPC
algorithm with computational tractability for autonomous driving applications.
Validation in the CARLA simulator demonstrates that our approach maintains
efficiency under high perception confidence while enforcing conservative

Result: 系统展示了其同步和触发多速率传感器的能力。

Conclusion: 该系统为实时、低成本时间戳需求提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: High fidelity estimation algorithms for robotics require accurate data.
However, timestamping of sensor data is a key issue that rarely receives the
attention it deserves. Inaccurate timestamping can be compensated for in
post-processing but is imperative for online estimation. Simultaneously, even
online mitigation of timing issues can be achieved through a relaxation of the
tuning parameters from their otherwise more performative optimal values, but at
a detriment to performance. To address the need for real-time, low-cost
timestamping, a versatile system which utilizes readily-available components
and established methods for synchronization is introduced. The synchronization
and triggering (of both high- and low-rate sensors) capabilities of the system
are demonstrated.

Result: 在8字形参考路径上的仿真表明，该框架能实现平滑稳定的惯性漂移。

Conclusion: 提出的学习框架有效解决了惯性漂移中的控制难题，提升了自动驾驶赛车的性能。

Abstract: Inertia drift is a transitional maneuver between two sustained drift stages
in opposite directions, which provides valuable insights for navigating
consecutive sharp corners for autonomous racing.However, this can be a
challenging scenario for the drift controller to handle rapid transitions
between opposing sideslip angles while maintaining accurate path tracking.
Moreover, accurate drift control depends on a high-fidelity vehicle model to
derive drift equilibrium points and predict vehicle states, but this is often
compromised by the strongly coupled longitudinal-lateral drift dynamics and
unpredictable environmental variations. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a learning-based planning and control framework utilizing Bayesian
optimization (BO), which develops a planning logic to ensure a smooth
transition and minimal velocity loss between inertia and sustained drift
phases. BO is further employed to learn a performance-driven control policy
that mitigates modeling errors for enhanced system performance. Simulation
results on an 8-shape reference path demonstrate that the proposed framework
can achieve smooth and stable inertia drift through sharp corners.

Conclusion: LeAD通过双速率架构和LLM增强，显著提升了自动驾驶系统在复杂场景中的表现。

Abstract: A principal barrier to large-scale deployment of urban autonomous driving
systems lies in the prevalence of complex scenarios and edge cases. Existing
systems fail to effectively interpret semantic information within traffic
contexts and discern intentions of other participants, consequently generating
decisions misaligned with skilled drivers' reasoning patterns. We present LeAD,
a dual-rate autonomous driving architecture integrating imitation
learning-based end-to-end (E2E) frameworks with large language model (LLM)
augmentation. The high-frequency E2E subsystem maintains real-time
perception-planning-control cycles, while the low-frequency LLM module enhances
scenario comprehension through multi-modal perception fusion with HD maps and
derives optimal decisions via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning when baseline
planners encounter capability limitations. Our experimental evaluation in the
CARLA Simulator demonstrates LeAD's superior handling of unconventional
scenarios, achieving 71 points on Leaderboard V1 benchmark, with a route
completion of 93%.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的联邦学习框架，用于高效训练抓取姿态检测模型，解决了通信开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抓取姿态检测（GPD）依赖大规模数据集，但数据隐私和集中化问题限制了其应用。联邦学习（FL）虽能保护隐私，但大模型的通信开销对资源有限的机器人不友好。

Method: 通过分析GPD模型各模块的学习动态，识别收敛较慢的模块，并在两阶段训练中优先优化这些模块以减少通信开销。

Result: 在GraspNet-1B数据集和真实机器人实验中，该方法在给定通信预算下表现优于FedAvg等基线，抓取成功率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架在通信成本和模型性能之间取得了更好的平衡，为去中心化训练鲁棒的GPD模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy,
but its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy
and centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the
substantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for
resource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL
framework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's
functional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to
which our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is
realized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is
followed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of
slower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated.
Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for
a given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical
robot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to
baseline methods in cluttered scenes. Our work presents a
communication-efficient framework for training robust, generalized GPD models
in a decentralized manner, effectively improving the trade-off between
communication cost and model performance.

Result: Dijkstra算法在2D和3D场景中均表现最稳定高效。

Conclusion: Dijkstra算法适用于静态地形导航，为动态路径规划研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments, such as forests
and mountainous regions, presents significant challenges due to irregular
terrain and complex road conditions. This work provides a comparative
evaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied
to weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite
imagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights
reflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel
Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe
satellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra,
RRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset,
which provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed
under identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost,
computation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra
consistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D
scenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial
road-maps. These findings highlight the reliability of Dijkstra-based planning
for static terrain navigation and establish a foundation for future research on
dynamic path planning under complex environmental constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in robotic grasping have led to its integration as a core
module in many manipulation systems. For instance, language-driven semantic
segmentation enables the grasping of any designated object or object part.
However, existing methods often struggle to generate feasible grasp poses for
small objects or delicate components, potentially causing the entire pipeline
to fail. To address this issue, we propose a novel grasping method, FineGrasp,
which introduces improvements in three key aspects. First, we introduce
multiple network modifications to enhance the ability of to handle delicate
regions. Second, we address the issue of label imbalance and propose a refined
graspness label normalization strategy. Third, we introduce a new simulated
grasp dataset and show that mixed sim-to-real training further improves grasp
performance. Experimental results show significant improvements, especially in
grasping small objects, and confirm the effectiveness of our system in semantic
grasping.

Motivation: CVC操作复杂且依赖操作者经验，错误可能导致严重后果。机器人系统虽能提供解决方案，但实现完全自主仍具挑战。

Method: 结合深度学习模型识别解剖标志，机器人运动规划扫描、分割和定位血管，并在超声引导下完成针插入。

Conclusion: 这是首个在高保真模型上验证的机器人CVC系统，展示了临床转化的潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Central venous catheterization (CVC) is a critical medical procedure
for vascular access, hemodynamic monitoring, and life-saving interventions. Its
success remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided
visualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further
complicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle
placement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems
offer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In
this work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline,
from scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a
deep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a
depth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously
define the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework
is proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and
arteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone.
Finally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance
with operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity
commercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The
proposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the
first attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15
\textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less
than or close to 1 \textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first
robotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated
planning, scanning, and insertion. Experimental results show its potential for
clinical translation.

Motivation: 在复杂任务环境中，操作员的工作负荷波动会影响任务表现，实时估计和调整工作负荷（尤其是语音负荷）是提升人机系统适应性的关键。

Method: 开发了一种实时估计语音工作负荷的算法，并分析了其准确性和对不同个体及人机协作模式的通用性。

Result: 算法能够准确估计语音工作负荷，并在不同个体和人机协作模式下表现良好。

Conclusion: 实时语音工作负荷估计是开发自适应人机系统的关键组成部分。

Abstract: Demanding task environments (e.g., supervising a remotely piloted aircraft)
require performing tasks quickly and accurately; however, periods of low and
high operator workload can decrease task performance. Intelligent modulation of
the system's demands and interaction modality in response to changes in
operator workload state may increase performance by avoiding undesirable
workload states. This system requires real-time estimation of each workload
component (i.e., cognitive, physical, visual, speech, and auditory) to adapt
the correct modality. Existing workload systems estimate multiple workload
components post-hoc, but few estimate speech workload, or function in
real-time. An algorithm to estimate speech workload and mitigate undesirable
workload states in real-time is presented. An analysis of the algorithm's
accuracy is presented, along with the results demonstrating the algorithm's
generalizability across individuals and human-machine teaming paradigms.
Real-time speech workload estimation is a crucial element towards developing
adaptive human-machine systems.

Abstract: Scrubbing surfaces is a physically demanding and time-intensive task.
Removing adhered contamination requires substantial friction generated through
pressure and torque or high lateral forces. Rigid robotic manipulators, while
capable of exerting these forces, are usually confined to structured
environments isolated from humans due to safety risks. In contrast, soft robot
arms can safely work around humans and adapt to environmental uncertainty, but
typically struggle to transmit the continuous torques or lateral forces
necessary for scrubbing. Here, we demonstrate a soft robotic arm scrubbing
adhered residues using torque and pressure, a task traditionally challenging
for soft robots. We train a neural network to learn the arm's inverse
kinematics and elasticity, which enables open-loop force and position control.
Using this learned model, the robot successfully scrubbed burnt food residue
from a plate and sticky fruit preserve from a toilet seat, removing an average
of 99.7% of contamination. This work demonstrates how soft robots, capable of
exerting continuous torque, can effectively and safely scrub challenging
contamination from surfaces.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了多机器人在时间关键任务中的协调效率和性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In disaster response or surveillance operations, quickly identifying areas
needing urgent attention is critical, but deploying response teams to every
location is inefficient or often impossible. Effective performance in this
domain requires coordinating a multi-robot inspection team to prioritize
inspecting locations more likely to need immediate response, while also
minimizing travel time. This is particularly challenging because robots must
directly observe the locations to determine which ones require additional
attention. This work introduces a multi-robot planning framework for
coordinated time-critical multi-robot search under uncertainty. Our approach
uses a graph neural network to estimate the likelihood of PoIs needing
attention from noisy sensor data and then uses those predictions to guide a
multi-robot model-based planner to determine the cost-effective plan. Simulated
experiments demonstrate that our planner improves performance at least by
16.3\%, 26.7\%, and 26.2\% for 1, 3, and 5 robots, respectively, compared to
non-learned and learned baselines. We also validate our approach on real-world
platforms using quad-copters.

Abstract: A novel algorithm is presented for the estimation of collision probabilities

Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world

Abstract: Perching on structures such as trees, beams, and ledges is essential for
extending the endurance of aerial robots by enabling energy conservation in
standby or observation modes. A tethered tensile perching mechanism offers a
simple, adaptable solution that can be retrofitted to existing robots and
accommodates a variety of structure sizes and shapes. However, tethered tensile
perching introduces significant modelling challenges which require precise
management of aerial robot dynamics, including the cases of tether slack &
tension, and momentum transfer. Achieving smooth wrapping and secure anchoring
by targeting a specific tether segment adds further complexity. In this work,
we present a novel trajectory framework for tethered tensile perching,
utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) through the Soft Actor-Critic from
Demonstrations (SACfD) algorithm. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal
demonstrations, our approach enhances training efficiency and responsiveness,
achieving precise control over position and velocity. This framework enables
the aerial robot to accurately target specific tether segments, facilitating
reliable wrapping and secure anchoring. We validate our framework through
extensive simulation and real-world experiments, and demonstrate effectiveness
in achieving agile and reliable trajectory generation for tensile perching.

Abstract: Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of
effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently
understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in
robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),
embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the
conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive
experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity
proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer
from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)
multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment
transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently
transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during
fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,
arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in
human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity
multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we
propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the
yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to
using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new
perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation
datasets effectively.

Conclusion: EC-Flow提供了一种无需动作标注的高效框架，适用于复杂操作场景，且易于实际部署。

Abstract: Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level
action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow
prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios
involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this
work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly
learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting
embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's
inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile
manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and
non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language
instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment
module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.
Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a
standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify
kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We
validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%
improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and
non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art
object-centric flow methods. For more information, see our project website at
