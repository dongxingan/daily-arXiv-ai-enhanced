### [1] [Acrobotics: A Generalist Approahc To Quadrupedal Robots' Parkour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02727)
*Guillaume Gagné-Labelle,Vassil Atanassov,Ioannis Havoutis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 通用垂直动力学强化学习算法，仅需25%训练代价即可达到专家策略的性能水平，解决四足机器人复杂动作执行的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四足机器人在复杂地形上具有更好的机动性能，但传统控制方法对滑移和摔倒等问题建模困难，需要更有效的解决方案

Method: 提出通用垂直动力学强化学习算法，通过尝试错误学习最优控制，避免传统建模方法的复杂性

Result: 学习到的策略性能与使用专家混合方法训练的最先进策略相当，但训练中只需使用25%的代理数量

Conclusion: 强化学习在四足机器人动力学控制中具有显著优势，能够以更少的训练资源获得优秀的通用性能，为复杂环境下的机器人控制提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Climbing, crouching, bridging gaps, and walking up stairs are just a few of
the advantages that quadruped robots have over wheeled robots, making them more
suitable for navigating rough and unstructured terrain. However, executing such
manoeuvres requires precise temporal coordination and complex agent-environment
interactions. Moreover, legged locomotion is inherently more prone to slippage
and tripping, and the classical approach of modeling such cases to design a
robust controller thus quickly becomes impractical. In contrast, reinforcement
learning offers a compelling solution by enabling optimal control through trial
and error. We present a generalist reinforcement learning algorithm for
quadrupedal agents in dynamic motion scenarios. The learned policy rivals
state-of-the-art specialist policies trained using a mixture of experts
approach, while using only 25% as many agents during training. Our experiments
also highlight the key components of the generalist locomotion policy and the
primary factors contributing to its success.

TL;DR: 情感对齐对机器人说服力和用户沟通风格无显著影响，但显著提升用户对机器人心理状态归因和共情感知


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究情感对齐作为共情沟通前提在HRI中的作用，探索其对机器人说服力、用户沟通风格和心理状态归因的影响

Method: 使用NAO机器人进行实验，42名参与者分为中性沟通组和情感自适应组进行对比

Result: 情感对齐不影响用户沟通风格和说服效果，但显著影响对机器人心理状态的归因和共情感知

Conclusion: 情感对齐虽不能提升说服力或改变沟通模式，但能有效增强用户对机器人心理能力和共情能力的认知

Abstract: The paper presents an experiment on the effects of adaptive emotional
alignment between agents, considered a prerequisite for empathic communication,
in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Using the NAO robot, we investigate the
impact of an emotionally aligned, empathic, dialogue on these aspects: (i) the
robot's persuasive effectiveness, (ii) the user's communication style, and
(iii) the attribution of mental states and empathy to the robot. In an
experiment with 42 participants, two conditions were compared: one with neutral
communication and another where the robot provided responses adapted to the
emotions expressed by the users. The results show that emotional alignment does
not influence users' communication styles or have a persuasive effect. However,
it significantly influences attribution of mental states to the robot and its
perceived empathy

TL;DR: 研究了使用虚拟现实和数字双胎来远程规划和控制汽车人进行屍体微创活检的新方法，诉求降低感染风险并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的屍体解剖是诊断死因和研穵疾病的金标准，但微创活检作为一种非侵入性方法受到越来越多关注。汽车人化微创活检可以进一步降低医生感染风险，但需要高效易用的规划和控制方法。

Method: 探索使用虚拟现实设备和数字双胎来实现完全远程的汽车人屍体微创活检规划和控制，对三种交互方澄进行了可用性研究，并在三体人类屍体上评估临床可行性。

Result: 进行了132次针插入操作，针头偏移误差为5.30±3.25 mm，成功获取了组织标本并经历史病理学验证。用户报告说针头放置方法非常直观。

Conclusion: 该系统是一种有前景、精确且低风险的替代方案，可以作为传统方法的替代选择。

Abstract: Studying tissue samples obtained during autopsies is the gold standard when
diagnosing the cause of death and for understanding disease pathophysiology.
Recently, the interest in post mortem minimally invasive biopsies has grown
which is a less destructive approach in comparison to an open autopsy and
reduces the risk of infection. While manual biopsies under ultrasound guidance
are more widely performed, robotic post mortem biopsies have been recently
proposed. This approach can further reduce the risk of infection for
physicians. However, planning of the procedure and control of the robot need to
be efficient and usable. We explore a virtual reality setup with a digital twin
to realize fully remote planning and control of robotic post mortem biopsies.
The setup is evaluated with forensic pathologists in a usability study for
three interaction methods. Furthermore, we evaluate clinical feasibility and
evaluate the system with three human cadavers. Overall, 132 needle insertions
were performed with an off-axis needle placement error of 5.30+-3.25 mm. Tissue
samples were successfully biopsied and histopathologically verified. Users
reported a very intuitive needle placement approach, indicating that the system
is a promising, precise, and low-risk alternative to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了学习型控制器在分布外环境中的安全问题，为无人机在地下环境中的自主导航提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Autonomously controlling quadrotors in large-scale subterranean environments
is applicable to many areas such as environmental surveying, mining operations,
and search and rescue. Learning-based controllers represent an appealing
approach to autonomy, but are known to not generalize well to
`out-of-distribution' environments not encountered during training. In this
work, we train a normalizing flow-based prior over the environment, which
provides a measure of how far out-of-distribution the quadrotor is at any given
time. We use this measure as a runtime monitor, allowing us to switch between a
learning-based controller and a safe controller when we are sufficiently
out-of-distribution. Our methods are benchmarked on a point-to-point navigation
task in a simulated 3D cave environment based on real-world point cloud data
from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event Dataset. Our experimental
results show that our combined controller simultaneously possesses the liveness
of the learning-based controller (completing the task quickly) and the safety
of the safety controller (avoiding collision).

*Yash Vyas,Matteo Bottin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于闭链平面五条架构的力平衡操纶器设计，包括2维和5维版本，通过实验验证了关节扭矩和反力矩的显著减少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一种力平衡操纶器，在最大化工作空间的同时满足力平衡条件，以减少关节扭矩和反力矩，实现毫米级精度

Method: 基于闭链平面五条架构构建模块化设计（Forbal-2和Forbal-5），讨论几何、运动学和动力学设计考虑，并从几何原理推导逆运动学

Result: 平衡配置导致平均反力矩减少66%，平均关节扭矩减少79%，Forbal-2位置误差显著降低；Forbal-5关节扭矩减少84%

Conclusion: 实验结果验证了平衡操纶器设计适用于需要减少关节扭矩和反力矩以实现毫米级精度的应用场景

Abstract: A force balanced manipulator design based on the closed chain planar five bar
linkage is developed and experimentally validated. We present 2 variants as a
modular design: Forbal-2, a planar 2-DOF manipulator, and its extension to
5-DOF spatial motion called Forbal-5. The design considerations in terms of
geometric, kinematic, and dynamic design that fulfill the force balance
conditions while maximizing workspace are discussed. Then, the inverse
kinematics of both variants are derived from geometric principles.
  We validate the improvements from force balancing the manipulator through
comparative experiments with counter mass balanced and unbalanced
configurations. The results show how the balanced configuration yields a
reduction in the average reaction moments of up to 66\%, a reduction of average
joint torques of up to 79\%, as well as a noticeable reduction in position
error for Forbal-2. For Forbal-5, which has a higher end effector payload mass,
the joint torques are reduced up to 84\% for the balanced configuration.
Experimental results validate that the balanced manipulator design is suitable
for applications where the reduction of joint torques and reaction
forces/moments helps achieve millimeter level precision.

Conclusion: 该研究为小规模城市农场提供了一种有效的植物表型分析方法，在花机姿态估计方面取得良好效果，代码开源可以促进进一步研究和应用

Abstract: The small scale of urban farms and the commercial availability of low-cost
robots (such as the FarmBot) that automate simple tending tasks enable an
accessible platform for plant phenotyping. We have used a FarmBot with a custom
camera end-effector to estimate strawberry plant flower pose (for robotic
pollination) from acquired 3D point cloud models. We describe a novel algorithm
that translates individual occupancy grids along orthogonal axes of a point
cloud to obtain 2D images corresponding to the six viewpoints. For each image,
2D object detection models for flowers are used to identify 2D bounding boxes
which can be converted into the 3D space to extract flower point clouds. Pose
estimation is performed by fitting three shapes (superellipsoids, paraboloids
and planes) to the flower point clouds and compared with manually labeled
ground truth. Our method successfully finds approximately 80% of flowers
scanned using our customized FarmBot platform and has a mean flower pose error
of 7.7 degrees, which is sufficient for robotic pollination and rivals previous
results. All code will be made available at
https://github.com/harshmuriki/flowerPose.git.

Conclusion: 这项工作成功整合了机器人技术、控制工程和互动艺术，为大规模动力安装提供了新的技术解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refurbishment of the interactive robotic
art installation Standards and Double Standards by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. The
installation features an array of belts suspended from the ceiling, each
actuated by stepper motors and dynamically oriented by a vision-based tracking
system that follows the movements of exhibition visitors. The original system
was limited by oscillatory dynamics, resulting in torsional and pendulum-like
vibrations that constrained rotational speed and reduced interactive
responsiveness. To address these challenges, the refurbishment involved
significant upgrades to both hardware and motion control algorithms. A detailed
mathematical model of the flying belt system was developed to accurately
capture its dynamic behavior, providing a foundation for advanced control
design. An input shaping method, formulated as a convex optimization problem,
was implemented to effectively suppress vibrations, enabling smoother and
faster belt movements. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in system performance and audience interaction. This work
exemplifies the integration of robotics, control engineering, and interactive
art, offering new solutions to technical challenges in real-time motion control
and vibration damping for large-scale kinetic installations.

Abstract: The quasi-repetitive nature of construction work and the resulting lack of
generalizability in programming construction robots presents persistent
challenges to the broad adoption of robots in the construction industry. Robots
cannot achieve generalist capabilities as skills learnt from one domain cannot
readily transfer to another work domain or be directly used to perform a
different set of tasks. Human workers have to arduously reprogram their
scene-understanding, path-planning, and manipulation components to enable the
robots to perform alternate work tasks. The methods presented in this paper
resolve a significant proportion of such reprogramming workload by proposing a
generalizable learning architecture that directly teaches robots versatile
task-performance skills through crowdsourced online natural language
instructions. A Large Language Model (LLM), a standardized and modularized
hierarchical modeling approach, and Building Information Modeling-Robot sematic
data pipeline are developed to address the multi-task skill transfer problem.
The proposed skill standardization scheme and LLM-based hierarchical skill
learning framework were tested with a long-horizon drywall installation
experiment using a full-scale industrial robotic manipulator. The resulting
robot task learning scheme achieves multi-task reprogramming with minimal
effort and high quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保约束满足是安全关键系统（如机器人）的核心需求，但非线性系统和约束下的安全性保障具有挑战性。控制不变集（安全集）是保证控制器安全性的重要工具

Method: 采用并行计算方法，同时求解多个MPC问题，每个问题在预测时域的不同时间步实例化安全集约束，然后根据用户定义的标准选择最优解

Result: 通过3关节机械臂的大量仿真验证，即使使用仅4个计算核心，也能在安全性和性能方面实现显著改进

Conclusion: 并行计算方法能够有效提高非线性约束系统的安全性和控制性能，为安全关键系统提供了一种实用的安全保障方案

Abstract: Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical
systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be
used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision
avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive
Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints, relying on
numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is
challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make
controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In
our previous work, we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the
safe-set constraint recede along the MPC horizon. In this paper, we push that
idea further by exploiting parallel computation to improve safety. We solve
several MPC problems at the same time, where each problem instantiates the
safe-set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the
controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined
criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint
robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved in terms of
safety and performance, even using as little as 4 computational cores.

### [11] [IL-SLAM: Intelligent Line-assisted SLAM Based on Feature Awareness for Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02972)
*Haolan Zhang,Thanh Nguyen Canh,Chenghao Li,Ruidong Yang,Yonghoon Ji,Nak Young Chong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种特征感知机制来解决动态SLAM中特征不足问题，通过动态决定是否激活线特征来减少计算复杂度和希望性噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态SLAM方法不断引入额外特征，导致计算开销过大和低质量特征积累问题，需要一种更智能的特征管理机制。

Method: 设计了特征感知机制，评估当前特征是否足够，仅在必要时才激活线特征支持。在后续处理中，线特征参与跟踪和位估但排除在全局优化外。

Result: 在TUM数据集上进行了广泛实验，与ORB-SLAM3基准线和其他动态SLAM方法相比，ATE和RPE指标都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态特征管理有效减少了计算复杂性，提高了动态环境下SLAM的稳健性和性能。

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a crucial role in
autonomous systems. Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment
assumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic
SLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic
features, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point
features for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by
continuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point
features, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current
methods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity,
causing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential
performance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and
noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism
that evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line
feature support should be activated. This decision mechanism enables the system
to introduce line features only when necessary, significantly reducing
computational complexity of additional features while minimizing the
introduction of low-quality features and noise. In subsequent processing, the
introduced line features assist in obtaining better initial camera poses
through tracking, local mapping, and loop closure, but are excluded from global
optimization to avoid potential negative impacts from low-quality additional
features in long-term process. Extensive experiments on TUM datasets
demonstrate substantial improvements in both ATE and RPE metrics compared to
ORB-SLAM3 baseline and superior performance over other dynamic SLAM and
multi-feature methods.

Abstract: The utilization of robotic technology has gained traction in healthcare
facilities due to progress in the field that enables time and cost savings,
minimizes waste, and improves patient care. Digital healthcare technologies
that leverage automation, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, have
the potential to enhance the sustainability and profitability of healthcare
systems in the long run. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has amplified
the need for cyber-physical robots to automate check-ups and medication
administration. A robot nurse is controlled by the Internet of Things (IoT) and
can serve as an automated medical assistant while also allowing supervisory
control based on custom commands. This system helps reduce infection risk and
improves outcomes in pandemic settings. This research presents a test case with
a nurse robot that can assess a patient's health status and take action
accordingly. We also evaluate the system's performance in medication
administration, health-status monitoring, and life-cycle considerations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出DUViN方法，通过知识迁移的深度特征实现水下视觉导航，无需预建地图即可进行4自由度运动控制，解决了水下数据稀缺和领域迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下自主导航面临传感能力有限和水下环境地图构建困难的问题，同时大规模水下导航数据集难以收集，需要解决从空中到水下环境的领域迁移挑战。

Result: 在模拟和真实水下环境中的实验证明了该方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DUViN方法通过创新的模型迁移策略，成功实现了水下视觉导航，解决了数据稀缺和领域适应问题，为水下自主导航提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited
sensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in
underwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater
Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN,
which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater
vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles
and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain
without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting
large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures
robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater
environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model
transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases:
we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets
using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor
on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into
the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both
simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalization of our approach. The experimental videos are available at

TL;DR: WOMD数据集在行为分析方面存在局限性，与真实AV操作数据相比，无法准确捕捉实际驾驶行为的动态变化和交互特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Waymo开放运动数据集(WOMD)是否能够准确反映真实世界自动驾驶车辆的操作动态和交互行为，因为该数据集存在专有后处理、缺乏误差量化以及轨迹分段等问题。

Method: 使用凤凰城独立收集的L4级AV自然驾驶数据(PHX)进行比较分析，涵盖三种典型城市驾驶场景：信号灯路口排队、跟车和变道行为。采用手动提取航拍视频中的车头时距、SIMEX方法处理测量误差、DTW距离量化行为差异。

Result: 所有场景分析一致显示PHX数据的行为特征都超出了WOMD的行为范围，WOMD低估了短车头时距和急减速行为。

Conclusion: 仅基于WOMD校准的行为模型可能系统性地低估自然驾驶的变异性、风险和复杂性，使用WOMD进行行为建模时需要谨慎并进行独立数据验证。

Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for
data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its
validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary
post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of
trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately
captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.
Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV
operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across
three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized
intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging
analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure
negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we
apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically
estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to
quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show
that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,
WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings
suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically
underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.
Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without
proper validation against independently collected data.

Conclusion: CTBC框架显著提升了轮式双足机器人在非结构化地形上的通过能力，为混合移动机器人提供了有效的障碍突破方案

Abstract: In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have gained increasing attention due
to their advantages in mobility, such as high-speed locomotion on flat terrain.
However, their performance on complex environments (e.g., staircases) remains
inferior to that of traditional legged robots. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a general contact-triggered blind climbing (CTBC) framework for wheeled
bipedal robots. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the robot triggers a
leg-lifting motion to overcome the obstacle. By leveraging a strongly-guided
feedforward trajectory, our method enables the robot to rapidly acquire agile
leg-lifting skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse
unstructured terrains. The approach has been experimentally validated and
successfully deployed on LimX Dynamics' wheeled bipedal robot, Tron1.
Real-world tests demonstrate that Tron1 can reliably climb obstacles well
beyond its wheel radius using only proprioceptive feedback.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in autonomous
systems. However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a
continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably
faced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on
test-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on
the fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.
However, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as
multiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for
test-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the
fine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications
where these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong
latency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$)
that leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of
continuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it
suitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware
self-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the
quantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp
improvements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard
test-time training protocol. Our proposed protocol offers a continuous setting
to identify the selected keyframes, allowing the end-user to control how often
to apply test-time training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a
dense regression task - monocular depth estimation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 主动训练框架通过精心选择训练数据，在仅使用52%序列数据的情况下达到了与全数据训练相等的性能，提升了深度LiDAR循轨测量模型的训练效率和演化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度LiDAR循轨测量模型需要大量多样化训练数据才能适应不同环境的问题，这导致训练效率低下。需要一种能够精心选择训练数据的方法来减轻训练负担并提升模型演化能力。

Method: 提出了主动训练框架，包括两个核心策略：初始训练集选择(ITSS)和主动增量选择(AIS)。ITSS将普通天气条件下的运动序列分解为节点和边进行轨迹分析，选择多样化序列构建初始训练集。AIS通过场景重建和预测不一致性来迭代选择复杂场景（如雪天）中的训练样本。

Result: 在多个数据集和不同天气条件下验证了方法的有效性。仅使用52%的序列数据量就能达到与全数据训练相等的性能水平，显示了该主动训练范式的高效性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 该主动训练框架通过优化训练过程，为更灵活可靠的LiDAR循轨测量系统奠定了基础，能够在多样化环境条件下实现更高精度的定位和导航。

Abstract: Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate
localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse
training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To
tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively
extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training
load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key
strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental
Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general
weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing
diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base
model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under
challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and
prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the
model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across
datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably,
our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of
the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of
our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach
sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of
navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.

TL;DR: 这篇论文比较了移动操作机器人的两种遥控体验方式（耦合与解耦）和两种视觉反馈机制（VR与屏幕），发现VR增加了工作负荷，而耦合方式在模仿学习性能方面更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在大规模数据收集中提高数据质量并降低操作员工作负荷，需要研究直观的遥控界面。尤其是在需要全身协调的长期移动操作任务中，强烈的体验感和最小化的物理、认知要求对于维持数据质量至关重要。

Method: 对比了两种机器人控制范式：耦合体验（整合手臂操作和底盘导航功能）和解耦体验（将这些系统作为独立控制实体）。还评估了两种视觉反馈机制：沉浸式虚拟现实和传统屏幕可视化。通过系统性评估复杂多阶段任务序列来进行分析。

Result: 结果显示，使用VR作为反馈方彞4f1a增加任务完成时间、认知工作负荷和遥控操作员的感知努力。耦合操作和导航导致的用户工作负荷与解耦体验相似，但预初实验表明通过耦合遥控获取的数据能够带来更好的模仿学习性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究为收集高质量、高维移动操作数据提供了全面的视角，展示了在考虑人类操作员需求的前提下，如何通过直观的遥控界面进行大规模数据收集的价值。

Abstract: Intuitive Teleoperation interfaces are essential for mobile manipulation
robots to ensure high quality data collection while reducing operator workload.
A strong sense of embodiment combined with minimal physical and cognitive
demands not only enhances the user experience during large-scale data
collection, but also helps maintain data quality over extended periods. This
becomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation
tasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot
control paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base
navigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as
separate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback
mechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based
visualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were
systematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring
integrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a
feedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and
perceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation
leads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while
preliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation
leads to better imitation learning performance. Our holistic view on intuitive
teleoperation interfaces provides valuable insight into collecting
high-quality, high-dimensional mobile manipulation data at scale with the human
operator in mind. Project

Abstract: Integrating generative AI such as large language models into social robots
has improved their ability to engage in natural, human-like communication. This
study presents a method to examine their persuasive capabilities. We designed
an experimental framework focused on decision making and tested it in a pilot
that varied robot appearance and self-knowledge. Using qualitative analysis, we
evaluated interaction quality, persuasion effectiveness, and the robot's
communicative strategies. Participants generally experienced the interaction
positively, describing the robot as competent, friendly, and supportive, while
noting practical limits such as delayed responses and occasional
speech-recognition errors. Persuasiveness was highly context dependent and
shaped by robot behavior: participants responded well to polite, reasoned
suggestions and expressive gestures, but emphasized the need for more
personalized, context-aware arguments and clearer social roles. These findings
suggest that generative social robots can influence user decisions, but their
effectiveness depends on communicative nuance and contextual relevance. We
propose refinements to the framework to further study persuasive dynamics
between robots and human users.

Abstract: Advancements in onboard computing mean remote sensing agents can employ
state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning at the edge. These
capabilities can be leveraged to unlock new rare, transient, and pinpoint
measurements of dynamic science phenomena. In this paper, we present an
automated workflow that synthesizes the detection of these dynamic events in
look-ahead satellite imagery with autonomous trajectory planning for a
follow-up high-resolution sensor to obtain pinpoint measurements. We apply this
workflow to the use case of observing volcanic plumes. We analyze
classification approaches including traditional machine learning algorithms and
convolutional neural networks. We present several trajectory planning
algorithms that track the morphological features of a plume and integrate these
algorithms with the classifiers. We show through simulation an order of
magnitude increase in the utility return of the high-resolution instrument
compared to baselines while maintaining efficient runtimes.
