We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only\nprovides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees\nnon-overlapping trajectories.

In this work,\nwe present a novel hybrid framework that adaptively fine-tunes model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) parameters online using outputs from a neural network (NN)\ntrained offline. The NN jointly predicts a reference pose and cost-function\nweights, conditioned on the coordinates of the gate corners and the current\ndrone state. To achieve efficient training, we derive analytical policy\ngradients not only for the MPC module but also for an optimization-based gate\ntraversal detection module. Furthermore, we introduce a new formulation of the\nattitude tracking error that admits a simplified representation, facilitating\neffective learning with bounded gradients. Hardware experiments demonstrate\nthat our method enables fast and accurate quadrotor traversal through narrow\ngates in confined environments. It achieves several orders of magnitude\nimprovement in sample efficiency compared to naive end-to-end RL approaches."}

The platform and data collection system is\ndesigned to meet the key requirements for evaluating multi-modal SLAM systems,\nincluding hardware synchronization of sensors, 6-DOF ground truth and loops on\nlong trajectories.\n  We run multimodal state-of-the art SLAM methods on the dataset, showcasing\nthe existing limitations in their application on agricultural settings.

Schön"], "title": "Robust Convex Model Predictive Control with collision avoidance guarantees for robot manipulators", "comment": null, "summary": "Industrial manipulators are normally operated in cluttered environments,\nmaking safe motion planning important. Furthermore, the presence of\nmodel-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in\npractice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances.\nThere is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be\nexecuted fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a\nrobust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free\nmotion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making\nour method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a\nsimulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered\nenvironments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark\nmethods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model\nuncertainties, while also yielding faster motion."}

This provides an interesting use\ncase to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in\nthe vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation\nbased on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how\npedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into\nthe implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and\nacceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,\na model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction\n(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,\nit is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and\ndecision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used\nframework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept\nfor an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model\nto learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL\nagent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a\nrisk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model\nlearned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and\nthereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the\nmodelled pedestrian. These results show this is a promising approach and\nencourage further exploration."}
