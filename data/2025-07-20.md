*Richard Marcus,Marc Stamminger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对LiDAR仿真的新颖视图合成方法，通过显式建模传感器特性（如滚动快门、激光功率变化和强度衰减）来实现更准确的LiDAR仿真，并展示了高级重仿真能力。


<details>

Conclusion: 通过显式建模LiDAR传感器特性，该方法实现了比现有技术更准确的LiDAR仿真，并具备先进的重仿真功能，为LiDAR仿真领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the
field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While
solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed,
LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling
sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and
intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared
to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,
as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model
component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced
resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in
the camera perspective.

*Yucen Wang,Rui Yu,Shenghua Wan,Le Gan,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FOUNDER框架结合基础模型（FMs）和世界模型（WMs）的优势，通过无奖励方式在具身环境中实现开放任务解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用FMs的通用知识和WMs的动态建模能力，解决复杂观测或领域差距下的任务泛化问题。

Method: 学习一个映射函数，将FM表示嵌入WM状态空间，通过想象学习目标条件策略，并利用预测的时间距离作为奖励信号。

Result: FOUNDER在多任务离线视觉控制基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂观测或领域差距场景中。

Conclusion: FOUNDER通过结合FMs和WMs，实现了任务语义的深度捕捉和高效解决，且奖励函数与真实奖励一致。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths
in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a
framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the
dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in
embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that
grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the
agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This
mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination
during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our
method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an
informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various
multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the
deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in
scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods
struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth
reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is

### [3] [ReAL-AD: Towards Human-Like Reasoning in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12499)
*Yuhang Lu,Jiadong Tu,Yuexin Ma,Xinge Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReAL-AD框架通过结合人类认知模型和视觉语言模型，提升自动驾驶的规划准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法依赖固定稀疏轨迹监督，无法模拟人类驾驶的层次推理过程。

Method: 提出ReAL-AD框架，包含战略推理注入器、战术推理整合器和分层轨迹解码器。

Result: 规划准确性和安全性提升30%以上。

Conclusion: ReAL-AD使自动驾驶更可解释且更接近人类推理。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising approach to unify
perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing
information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often
rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to
capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning
framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the
three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and
Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to
enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.
Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which
formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic
contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,
which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane
changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory
Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control
actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations
show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by
over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned
with human-like hierarchical reasoning. The project page can be found at:

*George Jiayuan Gao,Tianyu Li,Junyao Shi,Yihan Li,Zizhe Zhang,Nadia Figueroa,Dinesh Jayaraman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLMgineer利用视觉语言模型和进化搜索共同设计工具和操作策略，在多样化任务中表现优于人类设计和现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型是否能通过工具设计提升物理智能，将问题解决能力转移到工具设计上。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型的代码生成能力和进化搜索，迭代设计工具和操作策略。

Result: 在多样化任务中，VLMgineer设计的工具和策略更有效和创新，优于人类设计和现有工具。

Conclusion: VLMgineer展示了自动化工具设计的潜力，为未来研究提供了基准和代码。

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the
physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these
capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across
biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence
focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a
complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of
problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive
common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation
models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to
automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a
framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language
models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design
physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We
evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation
scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,
VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more
effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into
straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from
human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To
facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our
benchmark and code.

### [5] [DEMONSTRATE: Zero-shot Language to Robotic Control via Multi-task Demonstration Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12855)
*Rahel Rickenbach,Bruce Lee,René Zurbrügg,Carmen Amo Alonso,Melanie N. Zeilinger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DEMONSTRATE的新方法，通过利用任务描述的嵌入表示和逆最优控制工具，减少了对工程专业知识的需求，并解决了LLMs在控制系统中生成优化问题时的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在控制系统中表现出潜力，但其依赖于精心设计的任务示例，且缺乏评估幻觉的方法。

Method: 提出DEMONSTRATE方法，利用任务描述的嵌入表示和逆最优控制工具，避免使用LLMs生成复杂优化问题，并通过多任务学习确保任务相似性。

Result: 在模拟和硬件实验中，该方法有效减少了工程专业知识的需求，并能够提前评估幻觉。

Conclusion: DEMONSTRATE方法显著降低了LLMs在控制系统中应用的复杂性，并提高了任务执行的可靠性。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has
demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion
with a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of
LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the
design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,
employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task
examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained
engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for
hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose
DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex
optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding
representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from
inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task
demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures
target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that
hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance
of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering
expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced
multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of
hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm
tasked with tabletop manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 设计并部署了一个自主移动机器人MoistureMapper，用于土壤湿度传感，结合自适应采样策略，显著减少了旅行距离和湿度图方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有土壤湿度传感方法在大规模应用中成本过高，无法满足高分辨率需求，如精准灌溉。

Method: 开发了配备TDR传感器和直接推送钻探机制的机器人，采用高斯过程建模的自适应采样策略。

Result: 自适应采样策略比贪婪基准方法减少了30%的旅行距离和5%的湿度图方差。

Conclusion: MoistureMapper及其自适应采样策略为大规模土壤湿度传感提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Soil moisture is a quantity of interest in many application areas including
agriculture and climate modeling. Existing methods are not suitable for scale
applications due to large deployment costs in high-resolution sensing
applications such as for variable irrigation. In this work, we design, build
and field deploy an autonomous mobile robot, MoistureMapper, for soil moisture
sensing. The robot is equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and
a direct push drill mechanism for deploying the sensor to measure volumetric
water content in the soil. Additionally, we implement and evaluate multiple
adaptive sampling strategies based on a Gaussian Process based modeling to
build a spatial mapping of moisture distribution in the soil. We present
results from large scale computational simulations and proof-of-concept
deployment on the field. The adaptive sampling approach outperforms a greedy
benchmark approach and results in up to 30\% reduction in travel distance and
5\% reduction in variance in the reconstructed moisture maps. Link to video

### [7] [ZipMPC: Compressed Context-Dependent MPC Cost via Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13088)
*Rahel Rickenbach,Alan A. Lahoud,Erik Schaffernicht,Melanie N. Zeilinger,Johannes A. Stork*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ZipMPC是一种通过学习压缩和上下文相关的成本函数来模仿长时域MPC行为的方法，适用于短时域MPC，提升性能并保持低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MPC在实时系统（如机器人）中因计算负担而难以应用长时域预测的问题，同时优化长期目标和满足约束条件。

Method: 利用可微分MPC和神经网络传播梯度，学习短时域MPC的成本函数以模仿长时域行为。

Result: 在仿真和真实自动驾驶赛车实验中，ZipMPC表现优于基线方法，完成圈速接近长时域MPC，且能泛化到未训练过的赛道。

Conclusion: ZipMPC通过模仿长时域行为，显著提升了短时域MPC的性能，同时保持计算效率，适用于复杂实时系统。

Abstract: The computational burden of model predictive control (MPC) limits its
application on real-time systems, such as robots, and often requires the use of
short prediction horizons. This not only affects the control performance, but
also increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the
desired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates
a long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent
cost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative
methods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,
in particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)
maintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)
ensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to
environments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages
the concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients
of the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed
method in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC
consistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times
close to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the
short-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In
particular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during
training.

### [8] [Learning to Predict Mobile Robot Stability in Off-Road Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12731)
*Nathaniel Rose,Arif Ahmed,Emanuel Gutierrez-Cornejo,Parikshit Maini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习的方法（IMUnet）和视觉跟踪方法（C3 score），用于在非结构化地形中估计轮式移动机器人的稳定性，无需依赖传统物理模型或力传感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于物理的稳定性指标（如SSM或ZMP）需要精确的接触力、地形几何和机器人质心信息，这些在真实环境中难以准确测量。

Method: 使用轻量级神经网络（IMUnet）从本体感受数据直接估计稳定性，并开发了一种基于ArUco标记的视觉跟踪方法（C3 score）作为训练信号。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种地形和速度下表现良好，并能泛化到未见过的条件。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人任务（如精准操作和感知）提供了稳定性估计的新途径，尤其适用于农业和太空应用中的移动操作任务。

Abstract: Navigating in off-road environments for wheeled mobile robots is challenging
due to dynamic and rugged terrain. Traditional physics-based stability metrics,
such as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require
knowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise
center-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field
conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate
robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight
neural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot
stability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing.
  We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a
scalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score
captures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical
instability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based
model. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across
multiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously
unseen conditions. These initial results highlight the potential of using IMU
and robot velocity as inputs to estimate platform stability. The proposed
method finds application in gating robot tasks such as precision actuation and
sensing, especially for mobile manipulation tasks in agricultural and space
applications. Our learning method also provides a supervision mechanism for
perception based traversability estimation and planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ASC-SW的视觉辅助导航框架，结合轻量级视觉神经网络和深度相机，用于移动机器人导航，解决了传统LiDAR无法检测地面障碍物的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器无法检测地面障碍物（如电线），限制了移动机器人的导航能力。

Method: 设计了轻量高效的ASCnet分割模型，结合MobileNetV2和ASCSPP模块提取DLO特征，并引入滑动窗口后处理模块提升识别精度。

Result: 在自建数据集上达到75.3%的Miou分数，边缘设备上推理速度为9.3 FPS，优于现有DLO检测模型。

Conclusion: ASC-SW框架在推理速度和分割性能间取得平衡，成功应用于实际机器人平台。

Abstract: With the rapid development of lightweight visual neural network
architectures, traditional high-performance vision models have undergone
significant compression, greatly improving their computational efficiency and
energy consumption ratio. This makes them feasible for deployment on
resource-constrained edge computing devices. We propose a visual-assisted
navigation framework called Atrous Strip Convolution-Sliding Window (ASC-SW),
which leverages a depth camera and a lightweight visual neural network to
assist map-based mobile robot navigation. This framework compensates for the
inability of traditional light detection and range (LiDAR) sensors to detect
ground-level obstacles such as ground-level wires. We introduce a lightweight
and efficient segmentation model, Atrous Strip Convolution Network (ASCnet),
for detecting deformable linear objects (DLOs). MobileNetV2 is used as the
backbone network, and Atrous Strip Convolution Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASCSPP)
is designed to extract DLO features more effectively. Atrous Strip Convolution
is integrated into ASCSPP to accurately identify the linear structure of DLOs
with low computational cost. Additionally, a Sliding Window (SW)
post-processing module is proposed to denoise the output in complex
environments, improving recognition accuracy. Our method strikes a balance
between inference speed and segmentation performance. It achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (Miou) score of 75.3% on a self-built dataset and
reaches 9.3 FPS inference speed on the Jetson Orin Nano edge device. Overall,
our approach outperforms existing DLO detection models and has been
successfully validated on a physical robotic platform.

*Yasser G. Alqaham,Jing Cheng,Zhenyu Gan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究步态参数对四足机器人能量效率的影响，通过模拟和实验验证优化步态参数可显著降低能耗。

Motivation: 四足机器人的能量效率对其性能和自主性至关重要，但步态参数对能耗的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 建模Unitree A1机器人，开发可独立调整步态参数的控制器，在Gazebo中模拟不同步态参数和速度下的运动，并进行实验验证。

Result: 优化步态参数可显著降低能量消耗，提升四足机器人运动的整体效率。

Conclusion: 研究为四足机器人提供了节能控制策略，适用于商业化平台。

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a critical factor in the performance and autonomy of
quadrupedal robots. While previous research has focused on mechanical design
and actuation improvements, the impact of gait parameters on energetics has
been less explored. In this paper, we hypothesize that gait parameters,
specifically duty factor, phase shift, and stride duration, are key
determinants of energy consumption in quadrupedal locomotion. To test this
hypothesis, we modeled the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot and developed a
locomotion controller capable of independently adjusting these gait parameters.
Simulations of bounding gaits were conducted in Gazebo across a range of gait
parameters at three different speeds: low, medium, and high. Experimental tests
were also performed to validate the simulation results. The findings
demonstrate that optimizing gait parameters can lead to significant reductions
in energy consumption, enhancing the overall efficiency of quadrupedal
locomotion. This work contributes to the advancement of energy-efficient
control strategies for legged robots, offering insights directly applicable to
commercially available platforms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对动态或未映射对象的导航系统，结合LLM语义先验和主动在线方法，提高了检索成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高细节对象地图容易过时，因对象频繁移动，需解决动态或未映射对象的导航问题。

Method: 开发了从零开始考虑对象移动可能性的映射与导航系统，结合LLM语义先验和主动在线方法。

Result: 在静态和动态对象查询中，检索成功率更高且路径更短，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 系统通过结合环境背景与LLM语义先验，有效提升了动态或未映射对象的导航性能。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with
pre-trained visual-language features, achieving a high level of detail and
guiding robots to find objects specified by open-vocabulary language queries.
While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention,
another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes
outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping
and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up,
considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be
mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we
consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and
context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about
object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the
objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach
tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static
objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped
object queries. We provide our code and dataset at:

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉重复导航提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Though visual and repeat navigation is a convenient solution for mobile robot
self-navigation, achieving balance between efficiency and robustness in task
environment still remains challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate
localization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured
by lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we
develop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which
feature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based
on the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as
a keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative
motion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is
essentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current
observation and the map keyframe. To drive the robot to consistently reduce the
feature flow between current frame and map keyframes without accurate
localization, a probabilistic motion planning is developed based on our
qualitative feature flow-motion mapping indicator. Extensive experiments using
our mobile platform demonstrates that our proposed method is lightweight,
robust, and superior to baselines. The source code has been made public at
https://github.com/wangjks/FFI-VTR to benefit the community.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的分布外（OOD）场景可能导致危险行为，现有VLM虽能识别OOD场景，但其高层决策与低层轨迹预测存在不对齐问题。

Method: 提出LaViPlan框架，结合强化学习和可验证奖励，以规划导向指标优化VLM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了OOD条件下的情境感知和决策能力，缓解了对齐问题。

Conclusion: LaViPlan为自动驾驶中的VLM提供了一种有前景的后训练范式。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations
that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

Conclusion: MoCap2GT为SLAM基准测试提供了高精度地面真值轨迹，代码已开源。

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to
provide ground truth (GT) trajectories for benchmarking SLAM algorithms.
However, the accuracy of MoCap-based GT trajectories is mainly affected by two
factors: spatiotemporal calibration errors between the MoCap system and the
device under test (DUT), and inherent MoCap jitter. Consequently, existing
benchmarks focus primarily on absolute translation error, as accurate
assessment of rotation and inter-frame errors remains challenging, hindering
thorough SLAM evaluation. This paper proposes MoCap2GT, a joint optimization
approach that integrates MoCap data and inertial measurement unit (IMU)
measurements from the DUT for generating high-precision GT trajectories.
MoCap2GT includes a robust state initializer to ensure global convergence,
introduces a higher-order B-spline pose parameterization on the SE(3) manifold
with variable time offset to effectively model MoCap factors, and employs a
degeneracy-aware measurement rejection strategy to enhance estimation accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MoCap2GT outperforms existing methods and
significantly contributes to precise SLAM benchmarking. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在运动规划中表现优异，但无法直接优化非可微分目标（如碰撞避免和目标达成），需要改进训练方法。

Method: 采用强化学习训练扩散模型，引入奖励加权动态阈值算法，以优化非可微分目标。

Result: 在行人数据集（CrowdNav, ETH-UCY）上达到最先进性能，优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效学习非可微分目标，提升运动规划的安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Safe and effective motion planning is crucial for autonomous robots.
Diffusion models excel at capturing complex agent interactions, a fundamental
aspect of decision-making in dynamic environments. Recent studies have
successfully applied diffusion models to motion planning, demonstrating their
competence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal
future trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have
limitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions
rather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics.
However, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream
objectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness
(goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly
optimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training
scheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn
non-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.
Specifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to
shape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and
outperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art
performance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various
baselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective
motion planning.

Conclusion: 该框架为相机退化问题提供了系统化的鲁棒性需求分析方法，是整合噪声因子分析与情境覆盖的重要一步。

Abstract: AI-based robots and vehicles are expected to operate safely in complex and
dynamic environments, even in the presence of component degradation. In such
systems, perception relies on sensors such as cameras to capture environmental
data, which is then processed by AI models to support decision-making. However,
degradation in sensor performance directly impacts input data quality and can
impair AI inference. Specifying safety requirements for all possible sensor
degradation scenarios leads to unmanageable complexity and inevitable gaps. In
this position paper, we present a novel framework that integrates camera noise
factor identification with situation coverage analysis to systematically elicit
robustness-related safety requirements for AI-based perception systems. We
focus specifically on camera degradation in the automotive domain. Building on
an existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving
domain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain
specifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors
relevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to
identify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step
toward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support
principled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements
for camera-based AI perception.

Conclusion: VLN-PE为改进跨具身适应性提供了新途径，并推动更鲁棒的VLN模型发展。

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

Abstract: As robots find their way into more and more aspects of everyday life,
questions around trust are becoming increasingly important. What does it mean
to trust a robot? And how should we think about trust in relationships that
involve both humans and non-human agents? While the field of Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) has made trust a central topic, the concept is often
approached in fragmented ways. At the same time, established work in sociology,
where trust has long been a key theme, is rarely brought into conversation with
developments in robotics. This article argues that we need a more
interdisciplinary approach. By drawing on insights from both social sciences
and social robotics, we explore how trust is shaped, tested and made visible.
Our goal is to open up a dialogue between disciplines and help build a more
grounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in the evolving world
of human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile
robots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of
sensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to
find sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of
information collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming
that the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be
unknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active
area of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required
for mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP)
regression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial
fields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time
performance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for
mapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation
experiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against
existing benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to
further validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Results show that our
method achieves similar mapping accuracy to the baselines while reducing
computational complexity for longer missions.

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人中表现优异，超越现有方法，并在FetchBench基准测试中达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: GraspGen为抓取任务提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research
advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.

Result: 实验表明，基于EEG反馈训练的代理性能接近密集人工设计奖励的效果。

Conclusion: 隐式神经反馈为交互式机器人中可扩展且人类对齐的强化学习提供了潜力。

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

Conclusion: 结合接近和触觉传感器能提升接触状态和环境几何的识别能力，实现新工具使用技能的快速迁移。

Abstract: Tools extend the manipulation abilities of robots, much like they do for
humans. Despite human expertise in tool manipulation, teaching robots these
skills faces challenges. The complexity arises from the interplay of two
simultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another
between the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a
crucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool
manipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world
data and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot
tool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework
involves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in
tool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations
collected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate
that this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with
diverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations
on the Franka Emika robot arm. Our analysis suggests that the robot acquires
new tool-use skills by transferring the ability to recognise tool-environment
contact relationships from pre-trained to fine-tuned policies. Additionally,
combining proximity and tactile sensors enhances the identification of contact
states and environmental geometry.

Abstract: This work presents a novel co-design strategy that integrates trajectory
planning and control to handle STL-based tasks in autonomous robots. The method
consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to
encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an
STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ
reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform
trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives
to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based
STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification.
The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion
plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and
quadruped robots across various STL specifications. Demonstration videos are

Abstract: Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in

simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term
potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired

robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key
evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,
sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor
inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to
determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex
environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three
algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.
Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep
Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and
median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI
and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide
range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.
