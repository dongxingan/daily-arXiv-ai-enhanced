Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning\ncan also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often\nrequiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural\narchitecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised\napproaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on\nwhether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce\nobserved trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a\ncognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent\narchitecture for building a trajectory model.

Existing methods prioritize locomotion\nrobustness over compliance, often leading to stiff, high-frequency motions, and\nenergy inefficiency.

In the first stage, a velocity-tracking\npolicy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical\nproprioceptive features.

This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in\nresponse to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the\ncompliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor\ndisturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking\na balance between robustness and compliance.

In this paper, we introduce MISCGrasp, a volumetric grasping method\nthat integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature\nenhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction\nbetween high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer,\nwhile the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level\nfeatures, which synergistically strikes a balance between focusing on fine\ngeometric details and overall geometric structures. Furthermore, MISCGrasp\nutilizes multi-scale contrastive learning to exploit similarities among\npositive grasp samples, ensuring consistency across multi-scale features.\nExtensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate\nthat MISCGrasp outperforms baseline and variant methods in tabletop\ndecluttering tasks.

A unicycle design is\npresented which is capable of accelerating/breaking and carrying out a variety\nof maneuvers. The proposed path-planning method segments the path into straight\nand curved path sections dedicated for accelerating/breaking and turning\nmaneuvers, respectively. The curvature profiles of the curved sections are\noptimized while considering the control performance and the slipping limits of\nthe wheel. The performance of the proposed integrated approach is demonstrated\nvia numerical simulations."}

The use of robots in search and rescue has been studied but the\nquestion of where to start robot deployments has not been addressed. This work\naddresses the problem of optimally selecting starting locations for robots with\nheterogeneous capabilities by formulating a joint optimization problem. To\ndetermine start locations, this work adds a constraint to the ergodic\noptimization framework whose minimum assigns robots to start locations. This\nbecomes a little more challenging when the robots are heterogeneous (equipped\nwith different sensing and motion modalities) because not all robots start at\nthe same location, and a more complex adaptation of the aforementioned\nconstraint is applied. Our method assumes access to potential starting\nlocations, which can be obtained from expert knowledge or aerial imagery. We\nexperimentally evaluate the efficacy of our joint optimization approach by\ncomparing it to baseline methods that use fixed starting locations for all\nrobots. Our experimental results show significant gains in coverage\nperformance, with average improvements of 35.98% on synthetic data and 31.91%\non real-world data for homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, in terms of the\nergodic metric."}

Our approach first searches for\nmultiple collisionfree and topologically distinct paths for the mobile base to\nextract the space in which optimal solutions may exist. Further sampling and\noptimization are then conducted in parallel to explore feasible whole-body\ntrajectories. For trajectory optimization, we employ polynomial trajectories\nand arc length-yaw parameterization, enabling efficient handling of the\nnonholonomic dynamics while ensuring optimality."}

Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains\nchallenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has\nbenefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be\nnotoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has\nsucceeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still\nlargely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing\nMultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into\ntraditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase\nour framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on\nmultimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation\nvideo, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without\nany real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world\npouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of\ngenerative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the\nmultimodal sim-to-real gap."}
