Meanwhile, a UAM system, serving as an air taxi,\nrequires adaptive planning to respond to real-time passenger requests,\nespecially in ride-sharing scenarios where passenger demands are unpredictable\nand dynamic. However, conventional trajectory planning strategies based on\npredefined routes lack the flexibility to meet varied passenger ride demands.\nTo address these challenges, this work first proposes constructing a radio map\nto evaluate the communication quality of urban airspace. Building on this, we\nintroduce a novel Multi-Source Hybrid Attention Reinforcement Learning\n(MSHA-RL) framework for the challenge of effectively focusing on passengers and\nUAM locations, which arises from the significant dimensional disparity between\nthe representations. This model first generates the alignment among diverse\ndata sources with large gap dimensions before employing hybrid attention to\nbalance global and local insights, thereby facilitating responsive, real-time\npath planning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the approach\nenables communication-compliant trajectory planning, reducing travel time and\nenhancing operational efficiency while prioritizing passenger safety."}

Still, the inherent properties of cables, such as resilience,\nhysteresis, and friction, often lead to particular difficulties in modeling and\ncontrol. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) method that\nrelies exclusively on input-output data, without a physical model, to improve\nthe control accuracy of FCRAs. First, we develop an implicit model based on\ninput-output data and integrate it into an MPC optimization framework. Second,\na data selection algorithm (DSA) is introduced to filter the data that best\ncharacterize the system, thereby reducing the solution time per step to\napproximately 4 ms, which is an improvement of nearly 80%. Lastly, the\ninfluence of hyperparameters on tracking error is investigated through\nsimulation. The proposed method has been validated on a real FCRA platform,\nincluding five-point positioning accuracy tests, a five-point response tracking\ntest, and trajectory tracking for letter drawing. The results demonstrate that\nthe average positioning accuracy is approximately 2.070 mm. Moreover, compared\nto the PID method with an average tracking error of 1.418{\\deg}, the proposed\nmethod achieves an average tracking error of 0.541{\\deg}."}

However, due to low sampling efficiency,\ntheir performance often diminishes in complex configuration spaces with narrow\ncorridors. Existing approaches address this issue using handcrafted or learned\nheuristics to guide sampling toward useful regions. Unfortunately, these\nstrategies often lack generalizability to various problems or require extensive\nprior training. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient sampling-based\nplanning framework along with its bidirectional version that overcomes these\nissues by integrating different levels of planning granularity. Our approach\nprobes configuration spaces with uniform random samples at varying resolutions\nand explores these multi-resolution samples online with a bias towards sparse\nsamples when traveling large free configuration spaces. By seamlessly\ntransitioning between sparse and dense samples, our approach can navigate\ncomplex configuration spaces while maintaining planning speed and completeness.\nThe simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art sampling-based planners in $\\mathbb{SE}(2)$, $\\mathbb{SE}(3)$,\nand $\\mathbb{R}^{14}$ with challenging terrains. Furthermore, experiments\nconducted with the Franka Emika Panda robot operating in a constrained\nworkspace provide additional evidence of the superiority of the proposed\nmethod."}

Unlike conventional\ndifferentiable particle filters, which require importance weighting and\ntypically rely on predefined or low-capacity proposal distributions. DiffPF\nlearns a flexible posterior sampler by conditioning a diffusion model on\npredicted particles and the current observation. This enables accurate,\nequally-weighted sampling from complex, high-dimensional, and multimodal\nfiltering distributions. We evaluate DiffPF across a range of scenarios,\nincluding both unimodal and highly multimodal distributions, and test it on\nsimulated as well as real-world tasks, where it consistently outperforms\nexisting filtering baselines. In particular, DiffPF achieves an 82.8%\nimprovement in estimation accuracy on a highly multimodal global localization\nbenchmark, and a 26% improvement on the real-world KITTI visual odometry\nbenchmark, compared to state-of-the-art differentiable filters. To the best of\nour knowledge, DiffPF is the first method to integrate conditional diffusion\nmodels into particle filtering, enabling high-quality posterior sampling that\nproduces more informative particles and significantly improves state\nestimation."}

Existing HRI systems demonstrate great progress\nin interpreting and following user instructions, action generation, and robot\ntask solving. On the other hand, bi-directional, multi-modal, and context-aware\nsupport of the user in collaborative tasks still remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we present a gaze- and speech-informed interface to the assistive\nrobot, which is able to perceive the working environment from multiple vision\ninputs and support the dynamic user in their tasks. Our system is designed to\nbe modular and transferable to adapt to diverse tasks and robots, and it is\ncapable of real-time use of language-based interaction state representation and\nfast on board perception modules. Its development was supported by multiple\npublic dissemination events, contributing important considerations for improved\nrobustness and user experience. Furthermore, in two lab studies, we compare the\nperformance and user ratings of our system with those of a traditional scripted\nHRI pipeline. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based approach enhances\nadaptability and marginally improves user engagement and task execution metrics\nbut may produce redundant output, while a scripted pipeline is well suited for\nmore straightforward tasks."}

To push this\nboundary, we consider a generalized multi-object collection problem in large\nscene graphs, where the robot needs to pick up and place multiple objects\nacross multiple locations in a long mission of multiple human commands. This\nproblem is extremely challenging since it requires long-horizon planning in a\nvast action-state space under high uncertainties. To this end, we propose a\nnovel interleaved LLM and motion planning algorithm Inter-LLM. By designing a\nmultimodal action cost similarity function, our algorithm can both reflect the\nhistory and look into the future to optimize plans, striking a good balance of\nquality and efficiency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that compared with\nlatest works, our algorithm improves the overall mission performance by 30% in\nterms of fulfilling human commands, maximizing mission success rates, and\nminimizing mission costs."}

In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive,\nuniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how\nincorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both\nefficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image\nprocessing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both\nhuman head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA\nrobot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously\ncollecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as\nwell as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that\nincorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nin robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated\npatch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.\nCompared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number\nof tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions\nof interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction\nfrom human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide\nfoveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,\nallowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results\nshow that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces\ncomputational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks\nand robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that\nhuman-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic\nvision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/"}
