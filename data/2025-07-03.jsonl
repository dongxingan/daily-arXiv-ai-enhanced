This\nlimitation becomes particularly apparent in complex terrains. Obstacle\nnegotiation, a critical scenario exemplifying such challenges, requires both\nreal-time perception of obstacle geometry and responsiveness to user intention\nabout when and where to step over or onto, to dynamically adjust swing\ntrajectories. We propose a novel control strategy that fuses environmental\nawareness and human cooperativeness: an on-board depth camera detects obstacles\nahead of swing phase, prompting an elevated early-swing trajectory to ensure\nclearance, while late-swing control defers to natural biomechanical cues from\nthe user. This approach enables intuitive stepping strategies without requiring\nunnatural movement patterns. Experiments with three non-amputee participants\ndemonstrated 100 percent success across more than 150 step-overs and 30\nstep-ons with randomly placed obstacles of varying heights (4-16 cm) and\ndistances (15-70 cm). By effectively addressing obstacle navigation -- a\ngateway challenge for complex terrain mobility -- our system demonstrates\nadaptability to both environmental constraints and user intentions, with\npromising applications across diverse locomotion scenarios."}

However, directly training policies to\nsimultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due\nto unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address\nthis, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving\npriors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple\nstages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors\nthrough iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER\nprogressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration\nand policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or\nhandcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured\nthree-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation\nspace, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust\nmonopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the\nresulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional\nmethods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly\nspaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm.\nJumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing\nlocomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains."}

To address this issue,\nwe propose Spherical Diffusion Policy (SDP), an SE(3) equivariant diffusion\npolicy that adapts trajectories according to 3D transformations of the scene.\nSuch equivariance is achieved by embedding the states, actions, and the\ndenoising process in spherical Fourier space. Additionally, we employ novel\nspherical FiLM layers to condition the action denoising process equivariantly\non the scene embeddings.

To experimentally analyze and\nstudy the feasibility of AB-SF technique, we first used our robotic system\n(i.e., a CT-SDR integrated with a robotic arm) to create two different fixation\nscenarios in which two J-shape tunnels, forming a bridge, were drilled at\ndifferent depth of a vertebral phantom. Next, we implanted two FPSs within the\ndrilled tunnels and then successfully simulated the bone cement augmentation\nprocess."}

Previous dexterous\nteleoperation mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand\npostures. However, these approaches may fail to fully leverage the inherent\ndexterity of dexterous hands, which can execute unique actions through their\nstructural advantages compared to human hands. To address this limitation, we\npropose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables\ndexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion\npatterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the\nteleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to\ncomplete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible\ndexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures\nused in manipulation tasks. During teleoperation, we employ a MLLM\n(Multi-modality Large Language Model)-assisted type retrieval module to\nidentify the most suitable manipulation type based on the specific task and\noperator commands. Extensive experiments of real-world teleoperation and\nimitation learning demonstrate that the incorporation of manipulation types\nsignificantly takes full advantage of the dexterous robot's ability to perform\ndiverse and complex tasks with higher success rates."}

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT\nthrough extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile\nmanipulation tasks."}
