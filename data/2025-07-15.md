### [1] [OTAS: Open-vocabulary Token Alignment for Outdoor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08851)
*Simon Schwaiger,Stefan Thalhammer,Wilfried Wöber,Gerald Steinbauer-Wagner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OTAS提出了一种开放词汇的户外分割方法，通过直接从预训练视觉模型的输出令牌中提取语义结构，解决了现有方法在户外环境中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解开放世界语义对机器人规划和控制至关重要，尤其是在非结构化户外环境中。现有方法依赖对象中心分割先验，在户外环境中常因语义模糊和边界不清而失败。

Method: OTAS通过聚类单视图和多视图中的语义相似结构，并将其与语言对齐，构建几何一致的特征场，支持开放词汇分割查询。

Result: OTAS在零样本条件下运行，无需场景特定微调，速度达17 fps。在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，特别是在3D分割中改进显著。

Conclusion: OTAS适用于机器人应用，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Understanding open-world semantics is critical for robotic planning and
control, particularly in unstructured outdoor environments. Current
vision-language mapping approaches rely on object-centric segmentation priors,
which often fail outdoors due to semantic ambiguities and indistinct semantic
class boundaries. We propose OTAS - an Open-vocabulary Token Alignment method
for Outdoor Segmentation. OTAS overcomes the limitations of open-vocabulary
segmentation models by extracting semantic structure directly from the output
tokens of pretrained vision models. By clustering semantically similar
structures across single and multiple views and grounding them in language,
OTAS reconstructs a geometrically consistent feature field that supports
open-vocabulary segmentation queries. Our method operates zero-shot, without
scene-specific fine-tuning, and runs at up to ~17 fps. OTAS provides a minor
IoU improvement over fine-tuned and open-vocabulary 2D segmentation methods on
the Off-Road Freespace Detection dataset. Our model achieves up to a 151% IoU
improvement over open-vocabulary mapping methods in 3D segmentation on
TartanAir. Real-world reconstructions demonstrate OTAS' applicability to
robotic applications. The code and ROS node will be made publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在三维空间中预测自身运动意图结果的基本问题，探索更广泛的空间想象能力。

Method: 构建包含11k视频-意图对的数据集，开发两阶段训练计划，将基础模型训练为可控的世界模型。

Result: 成功训练出一个可控制的世界模型，能够根据运动意图预测未来观察序列。

Conclusion: AirScape为六自由度空中代理提供了一种有效的世界模型，展示了在复杂空间任务中的潜力。

Abstract: How to enable robots to predict the outcomes of their own motion intentions
in three-dimensional space has been a fundamental problem in embodied
intelligence. To explore more general spatial imagination capabilities, here we
present AirScape, the first world model designed for six-degree-of-freedom
aerial agents. AirScape predicts future observation sequences based on current
visual inputs and motion intentions. Specifically, we construct an dataset for
aerial world model training and testing, which consists of 11k video-intention
pairs. This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone
actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent
annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase
training schedule to train a foundation model -- initially devoid of embodied
spatial knowledge -- into a world model that is controllable by motion
intentions and adheres to physical spatio-temporal constraints.

### [3] [End-to-End Generation of City-Scale Vectorized Maps by Crowdsourced Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08901)
*Zebang Feng,Miao Fan,Bao Liu,Shengtong Xu,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EGC-VMAP是一个端到端框架，通过众包车辆数据生成高精度城市级矢量化地图，显著提升地图精度和鲁棒性，减少90%人工标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR制图成本高、速度慢，单车感知方法在恶劣条件下精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用Trip-Aware Transformer架构，融合多车、多时态地图元素，结合分层匹配和多目标损失函数。

Result: 在大规模多城市数据集上验证，性能优于单车基线，地图精度和结构鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: EGC-VMAP为城市级地图提供可扩展、经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: High-precision vectorized maps are indispensable for autonomous driving, yet
traditional LiDAR-based creation is costly and slow, while single-vehicle
perception methods lack accuracy and robustness, particularly in adverse
conditions. This paper introduces EGC-VMAP, an end-to-end framework that
overcomes these limitations by generating accurate, city-scale vectorized maps
through the aggregation of data from crowdsourced vehicles. Unlike prior
approaches, EGC-VMAP directly fuses multi-vehicle, multi-temporal map elements
perceived onboard vehicles using a novel Trip-Aware Transformer architecture
within a unified learning process. Combined with hierarchical matching for
efficient training and a multi-objective loss, our method significantly
enhances map accuracy and structural robustness compared to single-vehicle
baselines. Validated on a large-scale, multi-city real-world dataset, EGC-VMAP
demonstrates superior performance, enabling a scalable, cost-effective solution
for city-wide mapping with a reported 90\% reduction in manual annotation
costs.

### [4] [Multimodal HD Mapping for Intersections by Intelligent Roadside Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08903)
*Zhongzhang Chen,Miao Fan,Shengtong Xu,Mengmeng Yang,Kun Jiang,Xiangzeng Liu,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于摄像头-LiDAR融合的新框架，利用智能路边单元（IRU）生成高精语义地图，并发布了RS-seq数据集。该方法在语义分割任务上显著优于单模态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车辆方法在复杂路口的高精语义地图生成中存在遮挡和视角限制问题，需要更高效的多模态解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段融合框架，结合摄像头的高分辨率纹理和LiDAR的精确几何数据，通过RS-seq数据集进行验证。

Result: 多模态方法在RS-seq数据集上的mIoU比单模态图像和点云方法分别提高了4%和18%。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于IRU的高精语义地图生成提供了基准方法和数据集，推动了基础设施辅助自动驾驶系统的发展。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses
significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to
occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR
fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs).
Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the
systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes
precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from
roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections
annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings,
and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of
cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed
fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific
feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera
high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative
evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach
consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal
baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the
mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the
image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study
establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and
provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted
autonomous driving systems.

### [5] [C-ZUPT: Stationarity-Aided Aerial Hovering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09344)
*Daniel Engelsman,Itzik Klein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为C-ZUPT的方法，用于空中导航和控制，通过定义不确定性阈值识别准静态平衡，显著减少惯性漂移和控制能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星定位和摄像头在许多环境中可用性有限，导致依赖惯性传感器时精度迅速下降，需要替代的更新源来提供准确修正。

Method: 引入C-ZUPT方法，通过不确定性阈值识别准静态平衡，为估计滤波器提供精确速度更新。

Result: 验证表明，C-ZUPT显著减少惯性漂移和控制能耗，增强导航稳定性，延长持续飞行时间。

Conclusion: C-ZUPT有效解决了惯性导航的漂移问题，提升了资源受限空中系统的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous systems across diverse domains have underscored the need for
drift-resilient state estimation. Although satellite-based positioning and
cameras are widely used, they often suffer from limited availability in many
environments. As a result, positioning must rely solely on inertial sensors,
leading to rapid accuracy degradation over time due to sensor biases and noise.
To counteract this, alternative update sources-referred to as information
aiding-serve as anchors of certainty. Among these, the zero-velocity update
(ZUPT) is particularly effective in providing accurate corrections during
stationary intervals, though it is restricted to surface-bound platforms. This
work introduces a controlled ZUPT (C-ZUPT) approach for aerial navigation and
control, independent of surface contact. By defining an uncertainty threshold,
C-ZUPT identifies quasi-static equilibria to deliver precise velocity updates
to the estimation filter. Extensive validation confirms that these
opportunistic, high-quality updates significantly reduce inertial drift and
control effort. As a result, C-ZUPT mitigates filter divergence and enhances
navigation stability, enabling more energy-efficient hovering and substantially
extending sustained flight-key advantages for resource-constrained aerial
systems.

### [6] [Towards Human-level Dexterity via Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09117)
*Gagan Khandate*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过强化学习和模仿学习提升机器人多指手的灵巧性，克服了计算感觉运动学习的基本限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类灵巧智能是多指手复杂交互能力的体现，但机器人实现类似能力面临根本性挑战。论文旨在通过新方法解决这些限制。

Method: 采用结构化探索的强化学习方法，结合基于采样的规划和视觉触觉人类示范的模仿学习技术。

Result: 开发了一个高效的强化学习框架，显著提升了多指手的灵巧操作能力。

Conclusion: 通过直接解决根本限制，论文提出的方法为机器人实现人类级灵巧性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Dexterous intelligence -- the ability to perform complex interactions with
multi-fingered hands -- is a pinnacle of human physical intelligence and
emergent higher-order cognitive skills. However, contrary to Moravec's paradox,
dexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many
million years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich
tactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long
been a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward
general embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor
learning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary
in-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels
of dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational
sensorimotor learning.
  I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause.
Chiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an
effective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively
overcoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The
insights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that
incorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this
thesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for
dexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.

*Azfar Azdi Arfakhsyad,Aufa Nasywa Rahman,Larasati Kinanti,Ahmad Ataka Awwalur Rizqi,Hannan Nur Muhammad*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数据驱动的无人机建模软件，利用低成本传感器和滤波算法提高数据质量，通过融合IMU和GPS数据实现高精度实时位置和姿态可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机作为多功能平台需要精确建模支持开发测试，而低成本传感器和高效数据处理是提升建模精度的关键。

Method: 结合IMU（四元数表示避免万向节锁）和GPS数据，通过滤波算法和传感器融合技术优化数据质量，实现实时位置和姿态计算。

Result: 软件能够高精度、流畅地实时渲染无人机的位置和姿态。

Conclusion: 该数据驱动建模软件有效提升了无人机姿态和位置的可视化精度与实时性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have emerged as versatile platforms, driving
the demand for accurate modeling to support developmental testing. This paper
proposes data-driven modeling software for UAV. Emphasizes the utilization of
cost-effective sensors to obtain orientation and location data subsequently
processed through the application of data filtering algorithms and sensor
fusion techniques to improve the data quality to make a precise model
visualization on the software. UAV's orientation is obtained using processed
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and represented using Quaternion
Representation to avoid the gimbal lock problem. The UAV's location is
determined by combining data from the Global Positioning System (GPS), which
provides stable geographic coordinates but slower data update frequency, and
the accelerometer, which has higher data update frequency but integrating it to
get position data is unstable due to its accumulative error. By combining data
from these two sensors, the software is able to calculate and continuously
update the UAV's real-time position during its flight operations. The result
shows that the software effectively renders UAV orientation and position with
high degree of accuracy and fluidity

### [8] [Online 3D Bin Packing with Fast Stability Validation and Stable Rearrangement Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09123)
*Ziyan Gao,Lijun Wang,Yuntao Kong,Nak Young Chong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合装箱策略、结构稳定性验证和启发式规划的新框架，解决在线装箱问题中结构稳定性和安全重新配置的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法虽能提高容积利用率，但无法确保装箱的结构稳定性，且缺乏安全重新配置机制。

Method: 引入负载可承受凸多边形（LBCP）概念进行稳定性验证，并提出稳定重新规划（SRP）模块以安全重新配置。

Result: 实验表明LBCP验证高效且通用，SRP在节省重排成本方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际工业和物流应用提供了鲁棒且实用的自动化装箱解决方案。

Abstract: The Online Bin Packing Problem (OBPP) is a sequential decision-making task in
which each item must be placed immediately upon arrival, with no knowledge of
future arrivals. Although recent deep-reinforcement-learning methods achieve
superior volume utilization compared with classical heuristics, the learned
policies cannot ensure the structural stability of the bin and lack mechanisms
for safely reconfiguring the bin when a new item cannot be placed directly. In
this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates packing policy with
structural stability validation and heuristic planning to overcome these
limitations. Specifically, we introduce the concept of Load Bearable Convex
Polygon (LBCP), which provides a computationally efficient way to identify
stable loading positions that guarantee no bin collapse. Additionally, we
present Stable Rearrangement Planning (SRP), a module that rearranges existing
items to accommodate new ones while maintaining overall stability. Extensive
experiments on standard OBPP benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and
generalizability of our LBCP-based stability validation, as well as the
superiority of SRP in finding the effort-saving rearrangement plans. Our method
offers a robust and practical solution for automated packing in real-world
industrial and logistics applications.

### [9] [IteraOptiRacing: A Unified Planning-Control Framework for Real-time Autonomous Racing for Iterative Optimal Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09714)
*Yifan Zeng,Yihan Li,Suiyi He,Koushil Sreenath,Jun Zeng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于i2LQR的统一规划控制策略IteraOptiRacing，用于自动驾驶赛车环境中的竞争，优化圈速并避免碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶赛车环境中，需要一种能够同时优化圈速并避免与动态障碍物碰撞的策略。

Method: 基于i2LQR的统一策略，利用历史数据迭代优化轨迹，实现低计算负担和实时操作。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该策略在所有随机生成的赛车场景中均优于现有方法，实现了无碰撞和时间最优的轨迹。

Conclusion: IteraOptiRacing策略在自动驾驶赛车中表现出色，适用于实时竞争场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified planning-control strategy for competing with
other racing cars called IteraOptiRacing in autonomous racing environments.
This unified strategy is proposed based on Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator
for Iterative Tasks (i2LQR), which can improve lap time performance in the
presence of surrounding racing obstacles. By iteratively using the ego car's
historical data, both obstacle avoidance for multiple moving cars and time cost
optimization are considered in this unified strategy, resulting in
collision-free and time-optimal generated trajectories. The algorithm's
constant low computation burden and suitability for parallel computing enable
real-time operation in competitive racing scenarios. To validate its
performance, simulations in a high-fidelity simulator are conducted with
multiple randomly generated dynamic agents on the track. Results show that the
proposed strategy outperforms existing methods across all randomly generated
autonomous racing scenarios, enabling enhanced maneuvering for the ego racing
car.

### [10] [Tactile-VLA: Unlocking Vision-Language-Action Model's Physical Knowledge for Tactile Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09160)
*Jialei Huang,Shuo Wang,Fanqi Lin,Yihang Hu,Chuan Wen,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Tactile-VLA框架融合视觉、语言、动作和触觉感知，通过混合力-位置控制器和触觉反馈推理模块，实现精确物理交互和自适应策略调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升视觉-语言-动作模型在物理交互中的精确性，特别是在需要精细力控制的接触丰富场景中。

Method: 提出Tactile-VLA框架，结合混合力-位置控制器和触觉反馈推理模块。

Result: 实验证明Tactile-VLA在触觉感知指令跟随、触觉常识利用和自适应触觉推理方面具有有效性和泛化性。

Conclusion: VLM的先验知识已包含物理交互的语义理解，通过少量演示连接触觉传感器，可实现零样本泛化。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable achievements,
driven by the rich implicit knowledge of their vision-language components.
However, achieving generalist robotic agents demands precise grounding into
physical interactions, especially in contact-rich scenarios where fine-grained
force control is essential. We advance VLAs' implicit knowledge beyond
identifying what to do, towards guiding how to physically interact with real
world. This paper introduces Tactile-VLA, a novel framework that deeply fuses
vision, language, action, and tactile sensing. This framework incorporates a
hybrid position-force controller to translate the model's intentions into
precise physical actions and a reasoning module that allows the robot to adapt
its strategy based on tactile feedback. Experiments demonstrate Tactile-VLA's
effectiveness and generalizability in three key aspects: (1) enabling
tactile-aware instruction following, (2) utilizing tactile-relevant
commonsense, and (3) facilitating adaptive tactile-involved reasoning. A key
finding is that the VLM's prior knowledge already contains semantic
understanding of physical interaction; by connecting it to the robot's tactile
sensors with only a few demonstrations, we can activate this prior knowledge to
achieve zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.

Result: 在MetaDrive仿真环境中验证，框架能有效处理复杂交通场景，并在多种行为模型下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界自主导航挑战提供了广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason
about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we
introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal
predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We
develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction
uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a
Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a
closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical
tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing
mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of
behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal
uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation
scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that
our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios
with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust
performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad
applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges. Code and videos

Result: 生成了数百万个独特的可解多步任务，适用于机器人训练。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效生成可解任务，适用于机器人训练和数据集构建。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for the procedural construction of multi-step
contact-rich manipulation tasks in robotics. Our generator takes as input
user-defined sets of atomic actions, objects, and spatial predicates and
outputs solvable tasks of a given length for the selected robotic environment.
The generator produces solvable tasks by constraining all possible
(nonsolvable) combinations by symbolic and physical validation. The symbolic
validation checks each generated sequence for logical and operational
consistency, and also the suitability of object-predicate relations. Physical
validation checks whether tasks can be solved in the selected robotic
environment. Only the tasks that passed both validators are retained. The
output from the generator can be directly interfaced with any existing
framework for training robotic manipulation tasks, or it can be stored as a
dataset of curated robotic tasks with detailed information about each task.
This is beneficial for RL training as there are dense reward functions and
initial and goal states paired with each subgoal. It allows the user to measure
the semantic similarity of all generated tasks. We tested our generator on
sequences of up to 15 actions resulting in millions of unique solvable
multi-step tasks.

Method: 提出MRMEL框架，结合残差强化学习和专家混合模型，动态选择并优化子策略以适应不同交通场景。

Result: 在真实交通场景的案例研究中，MRMEL实现了比基线方法额外4%-9%的车辆排放减少。

Conclusion: MRMEL通过动态策略选择和残差学习，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆在多样化交通场景中的控制性能。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their
applications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as
mobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts
with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is
referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective
Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic
scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are
highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such
diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint
complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among
participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict
physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce
Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for
Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with
a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic
scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement
learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a
residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable
nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic
scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case
study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas
Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios.
The results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving
an additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the
strongest baseline in each setting.

Conclusion: 该方法无需基础设施或人工调参，开源且性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is crucial for improving
the foundational performance of three-dimensional (3D) map reconstruction
systems. This paper presents a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework
for multi-LiDAR systems that does not rely on overlapping fields of view or
precise initial parameter estimates. Unlike conventional calibration methods
that require manual annotations or specific reference patterns, our approach
introduces a unified optimization framework by integrating LiDAR bundle
adjustment (LBA) optimization with robust iterative refinement. The proposed
method constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning
from the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while
formulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This
method effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves
outlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism.
Extensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world
scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration
techniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for
non-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average
translational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2{\deg}, with an
initial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30{\deg}. Moreover, the calibration
process operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信任感知的博弈论换道决策框架（TGLD），通过动态评估人类驾驶车辆的信任水平，优化自动驾驶车辆的换道策略，提高效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AVs）需要与人类驾驶车辆（HVs）在异构交通环境中有效协作，但现有换道框架忽视了HVs的动态信任水平，导致行为预测不准确。

Method: 1. 构建多车辆联盟博弈模型，结合AVs的全合作行为和HVs的部分合作行为；2. 开发在线信任评估方法，动态估计HVs的信任水平；3. 考虑社会兼容性目标，最小化对周围车辆的干扰。

Conclusion: TGLD框架通过动态信任评估和社会兼容性设计，实现了更高效、安全的自动驾驶换道策略。

Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible
behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in
heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing
frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to
accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study
proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework.
First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully
cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs
informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust
evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during
lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate
cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered
by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the
predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and
context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment
conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.
Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different
HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism
significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and
contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非凸自由空间中路径规划的NP难问题，避免现有规划器在狭窄间隙或目标区域中的无效采样。

Method: 使用混合Zonotope分解无障碍空间，结合低维面采样和ellipsotope启发式，进行结构化探索。

Result: HZ-MP具有概率完备性和渐近最优性，能在有限时间内收敛到接近最优的轨迹，适用于高维复杂场景。

Conclusion: HZ-MP在非凸自由空间中表现出色，优于现有规划器，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Optimal path planning in nonconvex free spaces is notoriously challenging, as
formulating such problems as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) is NP-hard.
We propose HZ-MP, an informed Hybrid Zonotope-based Motion Planner, as an
alternative approach that decomposes the obstacle-free space and performs
low-dimensional face sampling guided by an ellipsotope heuristic, enabling
focused exploration along promising transit regions. This structured
exploration eliminates the excessive, unreachable sampling that degrades
existing informed planners such as AIT* and EIT* in narrow gaps or boxed-goal
scenarios. We prove that HZ-MP is probabilistically complete and asymptotically
optimal. It converges to near-optimal trajectories in finite time and scales to
high-dimensional cluttered scenes.

TL;DR: REACT框架通过实时几何模型和路径规划，解决了水下缆绳缠绕问题，提高了任务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下缆绳缠绕限制了复杂结构的检查效率，需一种实时避免缠绕的解决方案。

Result: REACT在模拟和实验中均实现全覆盖且无缠绕，任务完成时间缩短20%。

Conclusion: REACT有效解决了水下检查中的缆绳缠绕问题，提升了任务安全性和效率。

Abstract: Inspection of complex underwater structures with tethered underwater vehicles
is often hindered by the risk of tether entanglement. We propose REACT
(real-time entanglement-aware coverage path planning for tethered underwater
vehicles), a framework designed to overcome this limitation. REACT comprises a
fast geometry-based tether model using the signed distance field (SDF) map for
accurate, real-time simulation of taut tether configurations around arbitrary
structures in 3D. This model enables an efficient online replanning strategy by
enforcing a maximum tether length constraint, thereby actively preventing
entanglement. By integrating REACT into a coverage path planning framework, we
achieve safe and optimal inspection paths, previously challenging due to tether
constraints. The complete REACT framework's efficacy is validated in a pipe
inspection scenario, demonstrating safe, entanglement-free navigation and
full-coverage inspection. Simulation results show that REACT achieves complete
coverage while maintaining tether constraints and completing the total mission
20% faster than conventional planners, despite a longer inspection time due to
proactive avoidance of entanglement that eliminates extensive post-mission
disentanglement. Real-world experiments confirm these benefits, where REACT
completes the full mission, while the baseline planner fails due to physical
tether entanglement.

Method: 通过高维映射和稀疏随机投影构建轻量级地图，提出RPATR框架，结合前端路径优化和后端轨迹优化。

Result: 在多种场景中验证了框架在时间、内存和精度上的优越性能，实现了高效、安全的导航。

Conclusion: RMRP和RPATR框架为高速无人机和地面机器人提供了高效的导航解决方案，代码将开源以促进合作。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning,
faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy
computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and
traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of
perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random
Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight
linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space,
followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel
Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this
process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this
map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner)
framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance
Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to
refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a
closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP
model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive
navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form
gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in
diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in
time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe
navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster
community collaboration.

Result: 成功在仿真中测试了基于MPC的轨迹规划器。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于导航任务，还可用于MPC中实现逻辑或语言约束。

Abstract: In practice, navigation of mobile robots in confined environments is often
done using a spatially discrete cost-map to represent obstacles. Path following
is a typical use case for model predictive control (MPC), but formulating
constraints for obstacle avoidance is challenging in this case. Typically the
cost and constraints of an MPC problem are defined as closed-form functions and
typical solvers work best with continuously differentiable functions. This is
contrary to spatially discrete occupancy grid maps, in which a grid's value
defines the cost associated with occupancy. This paper presents a way to
overcome this compatibility issue by re-formulating occupancy grid maps to
continuously differentiable functions to be embedded into the MPC scheme as
constraints. Each obstacle is defined as a polygon -- an intersection of
half-spaces. Any half-space is a linear inequality representing one edge of a
polygon. Using AND and OR operators, the combined set of all obstacles and
therefore the obstacle avoidance constraints can be described. The key
contribution of this paper is the use of fuzzy logic to re-formulate such
constraints that include logical operators as inequality constraints which are
compatible with standard MPC formulation. The resulting MPC-based trajectory
planner is successfully tested in simulation. This concept is also applicable
outside of navigation tasks to implement logical or verbal constraints in MPC.

Result: 在多个机器人平台和任务中验证了方法的有效性，实现了稳健的任务性能和高保真的风格学习，ANYmal-D硬件上机械能降低14.5%，步态更敏捷。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够在保持任务性能的同时，有效学习演示中的风格，展示了实际应用中的优势。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration has proven effective in robotics for acquiring
natural behaviors, such as stylistic motions and lifelike agility, particularly
when explicitly defining style-oriented reward functions is challenging.
Synthesizing stylistic motions for real-world tasks usually requires balancing
task performance and imitation quality. Existing methods generally depend on
expert demonstrations closely aligned with task objectives. However, practical
demonstrations are often incomplete or unrealistic, causing current methods to
boost style at the expense of task performance. To address this issue, we
propose formulating the problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP). Specifically, we optimize a style-imitation objective with constraints
to maintain near-optimal task performance. We introduce an adaptively
adjustable Lagrangian multiplier to guide the agent to imitate demonstrations
selectively, capturing stylistic nuances without compromising task performance.
We validate our approach across multiple robotic platforms and tasks,
demonstrating both robust task performance and high-fidelity style learning. On
ANYmal-D hardware we show a 14.5% drop in mechanical energy and a more agile
gait pattern, showcasing real-world benefits.

efficient planning without requiring complete geometric representations. The
framework employs classifier-free guidance training and integrates local
potential fields during sampling to enhance obstacle avoidance. In dynamic
scenarios, the system generates initial trajectories using the diffusion model
and continuously refines them through potential field-based adaptation,
demonstrating effective performance in pursuit-evasion scenarios with partial

Result: 数据可用于优化编队、扩展操作范围并提升多旋翼控制的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究为多旋翼无人机的协调控制和密集环境应用提供了物理基础。

Abstract: Flying multiple quadrotors in close proximity presents a significant
challenge due to complex aerodynamic interactions, particularly downwash
effects that are known to destabilize vehicles and degrade performance.
Traditionally, multi-quadrotor systems rely on conservative strategies, such as
collision avoidance zones around the robot volume, to circumvent this effect.
This restricts their capabilities by requiring a large volume for the operation
of a multi-quadrotor system, limiting their applicability in dense
environments. This work provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the
downwash effect, with a focus on characterizing, analyzing, and understanding
forces, moments, and velocities in both single and multi-quadrotor
configurations. We use measurements of forces and torques to characterize
vehicle interactions, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) to quantify the
spatial features of the downwash wake for a single quadrotor and an interacting
pair of quadrotors. This data can be used to inform physics-based strategies
for coordination, leverage downwash for optimized formations, expand the
envelope of operation, and improve the robustness of multi-quadrotor control.

Conclusion: mmE-Loc系统通过多模态传感器融合，显著提升了无人机降落的精确性和效率。

Abstract: For precise, efficient, and safe drone landings, ground platforms should
real-time, accurately locate descending drones and guide them to designated
spots. While mmWave sensing combined with cameras improves localization
accuracy, lower sampling frequency of traditional frame cameras compared to
mmWave radar creates bottlenecks in system throughput. In this work, we upgrade
traditional frame camera with event camera, a novel sensor that harmonizes in
sampling frequency with mmWave radar within ground platform setup, and
introduce mmE-Loc, a high-precision, low-latency ground localization system
designed for precise drone landings. To fully exploit the \textit{temporal
consistency} and \textit{spatial complementarity} between these two modalities,
we propose two innovative modules: \textit{(i)} the Consistency-instructed
Collaborative Tracking module, which further leverages the drone's physical
knowledge of periodic micro-motions and structure for accurate measurements
extraction, and \textit{(ii)} the Graph-informed Adaptive Joint Optimization
module, which integrates drone motion information for efficient sensor fusion
and drone localization. Real-world experiments conducted in landing scenarios
with a drone delivery company demonstrate that mmE-Loc significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and latency.

Conclusion: TruckV2X数据集填补了重型车辆协同感知研究的空白，加速了多智能体自动驾驶卡车系统的部署。

Abstract: Autonomous trucking offers significant benefits, such as improved safety and
reduced costs, but faces unique perception challenges due to trucks' large size
and dynamic trailer movements. These challenges include extensive blind spots
and occlusions that hinder the truck's perception and the capabilities of other
road users. To address these limitations, cooperative perception emerges as a
promising solution. However, existing datasets predominantly feature light
vehicle interactions or lack multi-agent configurations for heavy-duty vehicle
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce TruckV2X, the first large-scale
truck-centered cooperative perception dataset featuring multi-modal sensing
(LiDAR and cameras) and multi-agent cooperation (tractors, trailers, CAVs, and
RSUs). We further investigate how trucks influence collaborative perception
needs, establishing performance benchmarks while suggesting research priorities
for heavy vehicle perception. The dataset provides a foundation for developing
cooperative perception systems with enhanced occlusion handling capabilities,
and accelerates the deployment of multi-agent autonomous trucking systems. The

Conclusion: Plan-MAE可作为基于学习的运动规划器的重要预训练步骤，提升自动驾驶车辆的预测与规划能力。

Abstract: Predicting the future of surrounding agents and accordingly planning a safe,
goal-directed trajectory are crucial for automated vehicles. Current methods
typically rely on imitation learning to optimize metrics against the ground
truth, often overlooking how scene understanding could enable more holistic
trajectories. In this paper, we propose Plan-MAE, a unified pretraining
framework for prediction and planning that capitalizes on masked autoencoders.
Plan-MAE fuses critical contextual understanding via three dedicated tasks:
reconstructing masked road networks to learn spatial correlations, agent
trajectories to model social interactions, and navigation routes to capture
destination intents. To further align vehicle dynamics and safety constraints,
we incorporate a local sub-planning task predicting the ego-vehicle's near-term
trajectory segment conditioned on earlier segment. This pretrained model is
subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks to jointly generate the prediction
and planning trajectories. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that
Plan-MAE outperforms current methods on the planning metrics by a large margin
and can serve as an important pre-training step for learning-based motion
planner.

Conclusion: 研究表明SNN在机器人导航中具有潜力，并公开了LIDAR数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Using neuromorphic computing for robotics applications has gained much
attention in recent year due to the remarkable ability of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) for high-precision yet low memory and compute complexity
inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This ability makes SNNs
well-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers)
where battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context,
this paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and
obstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a
LIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together
with the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance.
Crucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first
focused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN
precision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that
by carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to
achieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during
this work is released as open-source with the hope of benefiting future
research.

Result: 系统在自然户外环境中实现了稳健的归巢行为，资源占用低（内存小于9 kB），运行频率为8 Hz。

Conclusion: 该系统为自主视觉归巢提供了一种生物基础且资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few
learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While
Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have
not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world
implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a
compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path
integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during
learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the
right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We
validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation
showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled
learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks
using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal
behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to
control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and
functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite
relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with
32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a
biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual
homing.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on robotic grasping provide valuable insights into
evaluating and improving the robustness of these systems. Unlike studies that
focus solely on neural network predictions while overlooking the physical
principles of grasping, this paper introduces AdvGrasp, a framework for
adversarial attacks on robotic grasping from a physical perspective.
Specifically, AdvGrasp targets two core aspects: lift capability, which
evaluates the ability to lift objects against gravity, and grasp stability,
which assesses resistance to external disturbances. By deforming the object's
shape to increase gravitational torque and reduce stability margin in the
wrench space, our method systematically degrades these two key grasping
metrics, generating adversarial objects that compromise grasp performance.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios validate the effectiveness of
AdvGrasp, while real-world validations demonstrate its robustness and practical
applicability

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人导航提供了更高的灵活性和安全性。

Abstract: Safe navigation within a workspace is a fundamental skill for autonomous
robots to accomplish more complex tasks. Harmonic potentials are artificial
potential fields that are analytical, globally convergent and provably free of
local minima. Thus, it has been widely used for generating safe and reliable
robot navigation control policies. However, most existing methods do not allow
customization of the harmonic potential fields nor the resulting paths,
particularly regarding their topological properties. In this paper, we propose
a novel method that automatically finds homotopy classes of paths that can be
generated by valid harmonic potential fields. The considered complex workspaces
can be as general as forest worlds consisting of numerous overlapping
star-obstacles. The method is based on a hybrid optimization algorithm that
searches over homotopy classes, selects the structure of each tree-of-stars
within the forest, and optimizes over the continuous weight parameters for each
purged tree via the projected gradient descent. The key insight is to transform
the forest world to the unbounded point world via proper diffeomorphic
transformations. It not only facilitates a simpler design of the
multi-directional D-signature between non-homotopic paths, but also retain the
safety and convergence properties. Extensive simulations and hardware
experiments are conducted for non-trivial scenarios, where the navigation
potentials are customized for desired homotopic properties. Project page:

Abstract: Touch is recognized as a vital sense for humans and an equally important
modality for robots, especially for dexterous manipulation, material
identification, and scenarios involving visual occlusion. Building upon very
recent work in touch foundation models, this demonstration will feature
Octopi-1.5, our latest visual-tactile-language model. Compared to its
predecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from
multiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
module to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects
on-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld
tactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile
sensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with
Octopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will
showcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile
inputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5
will identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how
to handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also
plan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items.
With live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress
and limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in
this exciting field. Code for Octopi-1.5 and design files for the TMI gripper

Abstract: This work presents a vision-based underwater exploration and inspection
autonomy solution integrated into Ariel, a custom vision-driven underwater
robot. Ariel carries a $5$ camera and IMU based sensing suite, enabling a
refraction-aware multi-camera visual-inertial state estimation method aided by
a learning-based proprioceptive robot velocity prediction method that enhances
robustness against visual degradation. Furthermore, our previously developed

shows the robustness of the state estimation solution and the generalizability
of the path planning techniques across robot embodiments.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for
addressing complex control problems, particularly those involving underactuated
robotic systems. However, in some cases, policies may require refinement to
achieve optimal performance and robustness aligned with specific task
objectives. In this paper, we propose an approach for fine-tuning Deep RL
policies using Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to enhance control performance for
underactuated robots. Our method involves initially training an RL agent with
Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) using a surrogate reward function designed to
approximate complex specific scoring metrics. We subsequently refine this
learned policy through a zero-order optimization step employing the Separable
Natural Evolution Strategy (SNES), directly targeting the original score.
Experimental evaluations conducted in the context of the 2nd AI Olympics with
RealAIGym at IROS 2024 demonstrate that our evolutionary fine-tuning
significantly improves agent performance while maintaining high robustness. The
resulting controllers outperform established baselines, achieving competitive
scores for the competition tasks.

Abstract: This research introduces MP-RBFN, a novel formulation leveraging Radial Basis
Function Networks for efficiently learning Motion Primitives derived from
optimal control problems for autonomous driving. While traditional motion
planning approaches based on optimization are highly accurate, they are often
computationally prohibitive. In contrast, sampling-based methods demonstrate
high performance but impose constraints on the geometric shape of trajectories.
MP-RBFN combines the strengths of both by coupling the high-fidelity trajectory
generation of sampling-based methods with an accurate description of vehicle
dynamics. Empirical results show compelling performance compared to previous
methods, achieving a precise description of motion primitives at low inference
times. MP-RBFN yields a seven times higher accuracy in generating optimized
motion primitives compared to existing semi-analytic approaches. We demonstrate
the practical applicability of MP-RBFN for motion planning by integrating the
method into a sampling-based trajectory planner. MP-RBFN is available as
open-source software at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/RBFN-Motion-Primitives.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of foundation models, particularly Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), has introduced a transformative
paradigm in robotics. These models offer powerful capabilities in semantic
understanding, high-level reasoning, and cross-modal generalization, enabling
significant advances in perception, planning, control, and human-robot
interaction. This critical review provides a structured synthesis of recent
developments, categorizing applications across simulation-driven design,
open-world execution, sim-to-real transfer, and adaptable robotics. Unlike
existing surveys that emphasize isolated capabilities, this work highlights
integrated, system-level strategies and evaluates their practical feasibility
in real-world environments. Key enabling trends such as procedural scene
generation, policy generalization, and multimodal reasoning are discussed
alongside core bottlenecks, including limited embodiment, lack of multimodal
data, safety risks, and computational constraints. Through this lens, this
paper identifies both the architectural strengths and critical limitations of
foundation model-based robotics, highlighting open challenges in real-time
operation, grounding, resilience, and trust. The review concludes with a
roadmap for future research aimed at bridging semantic reasoning and physical
intelligence through more robust, interpretable, and embodied models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for whole-body torque control of
humanoid robots without joint torque sensors, designed for systems with
electric motors and high-ratio harmonic drives. The approach integrates
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for friction modeling and Unscented
Kalman Filtering (UKF) for joint torque estimation, within a real-time torque
control architecture. PINNs estimate nonlinear static and dynamic friction from
joint and motor velocity readings, capturing effects like motor actuation
without joint movement. The UKF utilizes PINN-based friction estimates as
direct measurement inputs, improving torque estimation robustness. Experimental
validation on the ergoCub humanoid robot demonstrates improved torque tracking
accuracy, enhanced energy efficiency, and superior disturbance rejection
compared to the state-of-the-art Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA), using
a dynamic balancing experiment. The framework's scalability is shown by
consistent performance across robots with similar hardware but different
friction characteristics, without re-identification. Furthermore, a comparative
analysis with position control highlights the advantages of the proposed torque
control approach. The results establish the method as a scalable and practical
solution for sensorless torque control in humanoid robots, ensuring torque
tracking, adaptability, and stability in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在实现无需约束人类控制或引发冲突的人机协作，通过准确推断人类意图。

Method: 采用双阶段框架：导航阶段结合控制器速度和占据网格生成Synergy Map；操作阶段结合U2Net、FastSAM和几何抓取可行性测试，实时更新对象概率。

Conclusion: GUIDER框架在移动操作任务的双阶段中均表现出优越的意图推断能力。

Abstract: Accurate inference of human intent enables human-robot collaboration without
constraining human control or causing conflicts between humans and robots. We
present GUIDER (Global User Intent Dual-phase Estimation for Robots), a
probabilistic framework that enables a robot to estimate the intent of human
operators. GUIDER maintains two coupled belief layers, one tracking navigation
goals and the other manipulation goals. In the Navigation phase, a Synergy Map
blends controller velocity with an occupancy grid to rank interaction areas.
Upon arrival at a goal, an autonomous multi-view scan builds a local 3D cloud.
The Manipulation phase combines U2Net saliency, FastSAM instance saliency, and
three geometric grasp-feasibility tests, with an end-effector kinematics-aware
update rule that evolves object probabilities in real-time. GUIDER can
recognize areas and objects of intent without predefined goals. We evaluated
GUIDER on 25 trials (five participants x five task variants) in Isaac Sim, and
compared it with two baselines, one for navigation and one for manipulation.
Across the 25 trials, GUIDER achieved a median stability of 93-100% during
navigation, compared with 60-100% for the BOIR baseline, with an improvement of
39.5% in a redirection scenario (T5). During manipulation, stability reached
94-100% (versus 69-100% for Trajectron), with a 31.4% difference in a
redirection task (T3). In geometry-constrained trials (manipulation), GUIDER
recognized the object intent three times earlier than Trajectron (median
remaining time to confident prediction 23.6 s vs 7.8 s). These results validate
our dual-phase framework and show improvements in intent inference in both
phases of mobile manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Developing robust locomotion controllers for bipedal robots with closed
kinematic chains presents unique challenges, particularly since most
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simplify these parallel mechanisms into
serial models during training. We demonstrate that this simplification
significantly impairs sim-to-real transfer by failing to capture essential
aspects such as joint coupling, friction dynamics, and motor-space control
characteristics. In this work, we present an RL framework that explicitly
incorporates closed-chain dynamics and validate it on our custom-built robot
TopA. Our approach enhances policy robustness through symmetry-aware loss
functions, adversarial training, and targeted network regularization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our integrated approach achieves stable
locomotion across diverse terrains, significantly outperforming methods based
on simplified kinematic models.

Abstract: Visual coverage path planning with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires
agents to strategically coordinate UAV motion and camera control to maximize
coverage, minimize redundancy, and maintain battery efficiency. Traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on environment-specific reward
formulations that lack semantic adaptability. This study proposes
Prompt-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL), a novel approach that integrates
the zero-shot reasoning ability and in-context learning capability of large
language models with curiosity-driven RL. PIRL leverages semantic feedback from
an LLM, GPT-3.5, to dynamically shape the reward function of the Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) RL policy guiding the agent in position and camera
adjustments for optimal visual coverage. The PIRL agent is trained using OpenAI
Gym and evaluated in various environments. Furthermore, the sim-to-real-like
ability and zero-shot generalization of the agent are tested by operating the
agent in Webots simulator which introduces realistic physical dynamics. Results
show that PIRL outperforms multiple learning-based baselines such as PPO with
static rewards, PPO with exploratory weight initialization, imitation learning,
and an LLM-only controller. Across different environments, PIRL outperforms the
best-performing baseline by achieving up to 14% higher visual coverage in
OpenAI Gym and 27% higher in Webots, up to 25% higher battery efficiency, and
up to 18\% lower redundancy, depending on the environment. The results
highlight the effectiveness of LLM-guided reward shaping in complex spatial
exploration tasks and suggest a promising direction for integrating natural
language priors into RL for robotics.

Abstract: Optimization has been widely used to generate smooth trajectories for motion
planning. However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when
dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel
computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently
solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this
paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the
Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which
decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in
parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per
iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that
integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the
optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality
constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness.
Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving
over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on
modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and
show high performance with thousands of segments.

Conclusion: 雷达在不同天气条件下的鲁棒性使其成为姿态估计系统的关键组件，尤其在视觉传感器性能下降时。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems are highly dependent on sensors like cameras,
LiDAR, and inertial measurement units (IMU) to perceive the environment and
estimate their motion. Among these sensors, perception-based sensors are not
protected from harsh weather and technical failures. Although existing methods
show robustness against common technical issues like rotational misalignment
and disconnection, they often degrade when faced with dynamic environmental
factors like weather conditions. To address these problems, this research
introduces a novel deep learning-based motion estimator that integrates visual,
inertial, and millimeter-wave radar data, utilizing each sensor strengths to
improve odometry estimation accuracy and reliability under adverse
environmental conditions such as snow, rain, and varying light. The proposed
model uses advanced sensor fusion techniques that dynamically adjust the
contributions of each sensor based on the current environmental condition, with
radar compensating for visual sensor limitations in poor visibility. This work
explores recent advancements in radar-based odometry and highlights that radar
robustness in different weather conditions makes it a valuable component for
pose estimation systems, specifically when visual sensors are degraded.
Experimental results, conducted on the Boreas dataset, showcase the robustness
and effectiveness of the model in both clear and degraded environments.

Conclusion: SC-ADAS证明了结合对话推理、场景感知和模块化ADAS控制的可行性，为下一代智能驾驶辅助提供了方向。

Abstract: While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret
scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems
typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based
interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to
driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a
modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large
language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling
to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS
supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing
natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented
in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes
confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model
fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and
revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased
latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated
dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining
conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support
the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.

Motivation: 解决机器人学习中生成模型在采样速度和架构约束之间的权衡问题。

Method: 使用MeanFlow Identity直接学习区间平均速度，结合CFG提升可控性，引入Dispersive Loss增强泛化能力。

Result: 在Adroit和Meta-World基准测试中表现优异，任务成功率比DP3高10.2%，比FlowPolicy高7.3%，推理速度快19倍。

Conclusion: MP1在机器人操作中实现了高效、精确的动作轨迹生成，适用于少样本学习和实际场景。

Abstract: In robot manipulation, robot learning has become a prevailing approach.
However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off
between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural
constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit
consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs
3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action
trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning
the interval-averaged velocity via the MeanFlow Identity, our policy avoids any
additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical
ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1
further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while
retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because
subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in
few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state
embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference.
We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in
real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average
task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its
average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster
than FlowPolicy. Our code is available at https://mp1-2254.github.io/.
