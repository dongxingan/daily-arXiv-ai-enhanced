Here, we present a physics-inspired\ncooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the\ndissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a\ndecentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous\nformation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of\nexplicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended\npayload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to\nenergy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control\nsystem is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors\nof the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches\nunder the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and\npayload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying\nrobots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success\nrate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,\nand 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor\nwinds up to Beaufort scale 4.

The pose\nestimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their\noperational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and\nmaintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the\nbuilding at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material\nproperties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors\nsuch as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing\nrobots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these\nenvironments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and\nelectromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary\nsource of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift\ncaused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the\nrobot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and\nLevenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting\nmethods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as\nstochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and\nresults of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail\nwith experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot."}

The force feedback and pose mirroring make\ntask demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,\nincreasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of\ndexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect\nhigh-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data\nsignificantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection\ncompared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot\ndexterity.

We present Egocentric Mobile MAnipulation (EMMA),\nan end-to-end framework training mobile manipulation policies from human mobile\nmanipulation data with static robot data, sidestepping mobile teleoperation. To\naccomplish this, we co-train human full-body motion data with static robot\ndata. In our experiments across three real-world tasks, EMMA demonstrates\ncomparable performance to baselines trained on teleoperated mobile robot data\n(Mobile ALOHA), achieving higher or equivalent task performance in full task\nsuccess. We find that EMMA is able to generalize to new spatial configurations\nand scenes, and we observe positive performance scaling as we increase the\nhours of human data, opening new avenues for scalable robotic learning in\nreal-world environments.
