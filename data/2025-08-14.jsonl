Each UAV must be able to make decisions during the flight\nin order to deal with uncertainties in its system and the environment, and to\nfurther act upon the information being received. Such decisions influence the\nfuture behavior of the UAV, which is expressed as the path plan. Thus,\ndecision-making in path planning is an enabling technique for deploying\nautonomous UAVs in real-world applications. This survey provides an overview of\nexisting studies that use aspects of decision-making in path planning,\npresenting the research strands for Exploration Path Planning and Informative\nPath Planning, and focusing on characteristics of how data have been modeled\nand understood.

Calibrated Prediction of Safety Chances for Image-Controlled Autonomy", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous robots that rely on deep neural network controllers pose critical\nchallenges for safety prediction, especially under partial observability and\ndistribution shift. Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited\nin scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while\nmodel-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses\nthese limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction\nin end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition\nmodel nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of\nworld models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to\nforecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the\nprobability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic\nand composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to\nquantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from\nhigh-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator\ncan deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding\nprediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to\nmiscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised\ndomain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution\nshift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides\ntheoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across\nlong prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that\nour UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower\nfalse positive rates under distribution shift. Similarly, world model-based\ncomposite predictors outperform their monolithic counterparts on long-horizon\ntasks, and our conformal calibration provides reliable statistical bounds."}

In this work, we propose a structured\nreward shaping framework that leverages model-based trajectory generation and\ncontrol Lyapunov functions (CLFs) to guide policy learning.

These planners define desired end-effector and joint\ntrajectories, which are used to construct CLF-based rewards that penalize\ntracking error and encourage rapid convergence. This formulation provides\nmeaningful intermediate rewards, and is straightforward to implement once a\nreference is available. Both the reference trajectories and CLF shaping are\nused only during training, resulting in a lightweight policy at deployment.

However, this two-stage decomposition framework\nsuffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each\nstage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the\nquality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,\nwe propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE\npolicy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and\nplanning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional\ndiffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future\nactions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint\npredictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible\ninstruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in\nimitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation\ntasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory\naugmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy.

The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object\nsize estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language\nmodel (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size\nestimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial\nparameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based\nrefinement and improving the overall estimation speed.

The assistance profile is formulated as a dual-Gaussian model\nwith the shank angle as the independent variable. Leveraging only IMU\nmeasurements, the model parameters are updated online each stride to adapt to\ninter- and intra-individual biomechanical variability. The profile tracking\ncontrol employs a human-exoskeleton kinematics and stiffness model as a\nfeedforward component, reducing reliance on historical control data due to the\nlack of clear and consistent periodicity in non-steady locomotion. Three\nexperiments were conducted using a lightweight soft exoskeleton with multiple\nsubjects. The results validated the effectiveness of each individual method,\ndemonstrated the robustness of the control system against gait perturbations\nacross various activities, and revealed positive biomechanical and\nphysiological responses of human users to the exoskeleton's mechanical\nassistance."}

In crawl spaces, current exteroceptive locomotion\nlearning methods are limited by large noises and errors of the sensors in\npossible low visibility conditions, and current proprioceptive locomotion\nlearning methods are difficult in traversing crawl spaces because only ground\nfeatures are inferred. In this study, a point cloud supervised proprioceptive\nlocomotion reinforcement learning method for legged robots in crawl spaces is\nproposed. A state estimation network is designed to estimate the robot's\nsurrounding ground and spatial features as well as the robot's collision states\nusing historical proprioceptive sensor data. The point cloud is represented in\npolar coordinate frame and a point cloud processing method is proposed to\nefficiently extract the ground and spatial features that are used to supervise\nthe state estimation network learning. Comprehensive reward functions that\nguide the robot to traverse through crawl spaces after collisions are designed.\nExperiments demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our method exhibits\nmore agile locomotion in crawl spaces. This study enhances the ability of\nlegged robots to traverse spatially constrained environments without requiring\nexteroceptive sensors."}

This paper introduces the Generalized\nBehavior Cloning (GBC) framework, a comprehensive and unified solution designed\nto solve this end-to-end challenge. GBC establishes a complete pathway from\nhuman motion to robot action through three synergistic innovations. First, an\nadaptive data pipeline leverages a differentiable IK network to automatically\nretarget any human MoCap data to any humanoid. Building on this foundation, our\nnovel DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with its MMTransformer architecture learns robust,\nhigh-fidelity imitation policies. To complete the ecosystem, the entire\nframework is delivered as an efficient, open-source platform based on Isaac\nLab, empowering the community to deploy the full workflow via simple\nconfiguration scripts. We validate the power and generality of GBC by training\npolicies on multiple heterogeneous humanoids, demonstrating excellent\nperformance and transfer to novel motions. This work establishes the first\npractical and unified pathway for creating truly generalized humanoid\ncontrollers."}

We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which\nthe reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique\nriver segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov\nDecision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which\nrefines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline\ncomputed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage\nestimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in\nnon-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on\npatchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and\ndata-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent\nvision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics\nEstimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM\nfor cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of\nsolving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.\nSimulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and\nsuperior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized\nAdvantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions\nthat enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,\nCADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the\nLagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during\ntraining, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard\naction overlay."}

We\nintroduce Masquerade, a method that edits in-the-wild egocentric human videos\nto bridge the visual embodiment gap between humans and robots and then learns a\nrobot policy with these edited videos. Our pipeline turns each human video into\nrobotized demonstrations by (i) estimating 3-D hand poses, (ii) inpainting the\nhuman arms, and (iii) overlaying a rendered bimanual robot that tracks the\nrecovered end-effector trajectories. Pre-training a visual encoder to predict\nfuture 2-D robot keypoints on 675K frames of these edited clips, and continuing\nthat auxiliary loss while fine-tuning a diffusion policy head on only 50 robot\ndemonstrations per task, yields policies that generalize significantly better\nthan prior work. On three long-horizon, bimanual kitchen tasks evaluated in\nthree unseen scenes each, Masquerade outperforms baselines by 5-6x. Ablations\nshow that both the robot overlay and co-training are indispensable, and\nperformance scales logarithmically with the amount of edited human video. These\nresults demonstrate that explicitly closing the visual embodiment gap unlocks a\nvast, readily available source of data from human videos that can be used to\nimprove robot policies."}
