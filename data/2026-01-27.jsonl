While robotic automation offers solutions, construction robots struggle to adapt to unstructured, dynamic sites. Central to this is improvisation, adapting to unexpected situations through creative problem-solving, which remains predominantly human. In construction's unpredictable environments, collaborative human-robot improvisation is essential for workflow continuity. This research develops a six-level taxonomy classifying human-robot collaboration (HRC) based on improvisation capabilities. Through systematic review of 214 articles (2010-2025), we categorize construction robotics across: Manual Work (Level 0), Human-Controlled Execution (Level 1), Adaptive Manipulation (Level 2), Imitation Learning (Level 3), Human-in-Loop BIM Workflow (Level 4), Cloud-Based Knowledge Integration (Level 5), and True Collaborative Improvisation (Level 6). Analysis reveals current research concentrates at lower levels, with critical gaps in experiential learning and limited progression toward collaborative improvisation. A five-dimensional radar framework illustrates progressive evolution of Planning, Cognitive Role, Physical Execution, Learning Capability, and Improvisation, demonstrating how complementary human-robot capabilities create team performance exceeding individual contributions. The research identifies three fundamental barriers: technical limitations in grounding and dialogic reasoning, conceptual gaps between human improvisation and robotics research, and methodological challenges. We recommend future research emphasizing improved human-robot communication via Augmented/Virtual Reality interfaces, large language model integration, and cloud-based knowledge systems to advance toward true collaborative improvisation."}

In this work, we present the quantitative evaluation of ergonomics and comfort of the Elevate suit - a cable driven soft robotic suit that assists shoulder elevation. Using a motion-capture system and force sensors, we measured the suit's ergonomics during assisted shoulder elevation up to 70 degrees.

We estimated that the pressure applied to the shoulder during assisted movements was within the range seen in a human grasp (approximately 69.1-85.1kPa), and estimated volumetric compression of <3% and <8% across the torso and upper arm, respectively. These results provide early validation of Elevate's ergonomic design in preparation for future studies with patient groups."}

Our system encodes the prompt along with an initial visual snapshot from the onboard camera, and a diffusion model samples plausible spatio-temporal motion plans that satisfy both the scene geometry and shot semantics. The generated flight trajectory is then executed autonomously by the UAV to record smooth, repeatable video clips that match the prompt. User evaluation using NASA-TLX showed a significantly lower overall workload with our interface (M = 21.6) compared to a traditional remote controller (M = 58.1), demonstrating a substantial reduction in perceived effort.

However, point cloud-based policies remain highly sensitive to sensor noise, pose perturbations, and occlusion-induced artifacts, which distort geometric structure and break the equivariance assumptions required for robust generalization. Existing equivariant approaches primarily encode symmetry constraints into neural architectures, but do not explicitly correct noise-induced geometric deviations or enforce equivariant consistency in learned representations. We introduce EquiForm, a noise-robust SE(3)-equivariant policy learning framework for point cloud-based manipulation. EquiForm formalizes how noise-induced geometric distortions lead to equivariance deviations in observation-to-action mappings, and introduces a geometric denoising module to restore consistent 3D structure under noisy or incomplete observations. In addition, we propose a contrastive equivariant alignment objective that enforces representation consistency under both rigid transformations and noise perturbations. Built upon these components, EquiForm forms a flexible policy learning pipeline that integrates noise-robust geometric reasoning with modern generative models. We evaluate EquiForm on 16 simulated tasks and 4 real-world manipulation tasks across diverse objects and scene layouts. Compared to state-of-the-art point cloud imitation learning methods, EquiForm achieves an average improvement of 17.2% in simulation and 28.1% in real-world experiments, demonstrating strong noise robustness and spatial generalization."}

Yet, due to resource constraints, tiny aerial robots, perfectly suited for these operations, are unable to navigate in the darkness to find survivors safely. In this paper, we present an autonomous aerial robot for navigation in the dark by combining an Infra-Red (IR) monocular camera with a large-aperture coded lens and structured light without external infrastructure like GPS or motion-capture. Our approach obtains depth-dependent defocus cues (each structured light point appears as a pattern that is depth dependent), which acts as a strong prior for our AsterNet deep depth estimation model. The model is trained in simulation by generating data using a simple optical model and transfers directly to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining. AsterNet runs onboard the robot at 20 Hz on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin$^\\text{TM}$ Nano. Furthermore, our network is robust to changes in the structured light pattern and relative placement of the pattern emitter and IR camera, leading to simplified and cost-effective construction. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate our proposed depth navigation approach AsterNav using depth from AsterNet in many real-world experiments using only onboard sensing and computation, including dark matte obstacles and thin ropes (diameter 6.25mm), achieving an overall success rate of 95.5% with unknown object shapes, locations and materials.

While deep neural networks have been successfully used for vision-based tasks, they inherently lack provable guarantees on the correctness of their output, which is crucial for safety-critical applications. We present a framework for designing certifiable neural networks (NNs) for perception-based pose estimation that integrates physics-driven modeling with learning-based estimation. The proposed framework begins by leveraging the known geometry of planar objects commonly found in the environment, such as traffic signs and runway markings, referred to as target objects. At its core, it introduces a geometric generative model (GGM), a neural-network-like model whose parameters are derived from the image formation process of a target object observed by a camera. Once designed, the GGM can be used to train NN-based pose estimators with certified guarantees in terms of their estimation errors. We first demonstrate this framework in uncluttered environments, where the target object is the only object present in the camera's field of view. We extend this using ideas from NN reachability analysis to design certified object NN that can detect the presence of the target object in cluttered environments. Subsequently, the framework consolidates the certified object detector with the certified pose estimator to design a multi-stage perception pipeline that generalizes the proposed approach to cluttered environments, while maintaining its certified guarantees. We evaluate the proposed framework using both synthetic and real images of various planar objects commonly encountered by autonomous vehicles. Using images captured by an event-based camera, we show that the trained encoder can effectively estimate the pose of a traffic sign in accordance with the certified bound provided by the framework."}

Generative world models offer a promising alternative for general-purpose embodied AI, yet a critical gap remains between their pixel-level plans and physically executable actions.\n  To this end, we propose the Tool-Centric Inverse Dynamics Model (TC-IDM). By focusing on the tool's imagined trajectory as synthesized by the world model, TC-IDM establishes a robust intermediate representation that bridges the gap between visual planning and physical control.\n  TC-IDM extracts the tool's point cloud trajectories via segmentation and 3D motion estimation from generated videos. Considering diverse tool attributes, our architecture employs decoupled action heads to project these planned trajectories into 6-DoF end-effector motions and corresponding control signals.\n  This plan-and-translate paradigm not only supports a wide range of end-effectors but also significantly improves viewpoint invariance. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities across long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks, including interacting with deformable objects.\n  In real-world evaluations, the world model with TC-IDM achieves an average success rate of 61.11 percent, with 77.7 percent on simple tasks and 38.46 percent on zero-shot deformable object tasks. It substantially outperforms end-to-end VLA-style baselines and other inverse dynamics models."}

Crash reports provide authentic specifications of safety-critical events, offering a vital alternative to scarce real-world collision trajectory data. This makes them valuable sources for generating realistic high-risk scenarios through simulation. Existing approaches face significant limitations because data-driven methods lack diversity due to their reliance on existing latent distributions, whereas adversarial methods often produce unrealistic scenarios lacking physical fidelity. Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM)-based methods show significant promise. However, they suffer from context suppression issues where internal parametric knowledge overrides crash specifications, producing scenarios that deviate from actual accident characteristics. This paper presents SG-CADVLM (A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation), a framework that integrates Context-Aware Decoding with multi-modal input processing to generate safety-critical scenarios from crash reports and road network diagrams. The framework mitigates VLM hallucination issues while enabling the simultaneous generation of road geometry and vehicle trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate that SG-CADVLM generates critical risk scenarios at a rate of 84.4% compared to 12.5% for the baseline methods, representing an improvement of 469%, while producing executable simulations for autonomous vehicle testing."}

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled language-driven navigation with improved interpretability. However, most LLM-based agents still rely on single-shot action decisions, where the model must choose one option from noisy, textualized multi-perspective observations. Due to local mismatches and imperfect intermediate reasoning, such decisions can easily deviate from the correct path, leading to error accumulation and reduced reliability in unseen environments. In this paper, we propose DV-VLN, a new VLN framework that follows a generate-then-verify paradigm. DV-VLN first performs parameter-efficient in-domain adaptation of an open-source LLaMA-2 backbone to produce a structured navigational chain-of-thought, and then verifies candidate actions with two complementary channels: True-False Verification (TFV) and Masked-Entity Verification (MEV). DV-VLN selects actions by aggregating verification successes across multiple samples, yielding interpretable scores for reranking. Experiments on R2R, RxR (English subset), and REVERIE show that DV-VLN consistently improves over direct prediction and sampling-only baselines, achieving competitive performance among language-only VLN agents and promising results compared with several cross-modal systems.Code is available at https://github.com/PlumJun/DV-VLN."}

Existing methods often struggle to maintain global directional consistency, leading to drifting or implausible trajectories when extrapolated over long time horizons. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-key-point-conditioned trajectory modeling framework, in which future trajectories are predicted by conditioning on a high-level Next Key Point (NKP) that captures navigational intent. This formulation decomposes long-horizon prediction into global semantic decision-making and local motion modeling, effectively restricting the support of future trajectories to semantically feasible subsets. To efficiently estimate the NKP prior from historical observations, we adopt a pretrain-finetune strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world AIS data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for long travel durations, directional accuracy, and fine-grained trajectory prediction."}

Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDF) enable fixed-base manipulators to model collisions directly in configuration space via smooth, implicit distances. This representation holds strong potential to bypass the nonlinear configuration-to-workspace mapping while preserving accurate whole-body geometry and providing optimization-friendly collision costs. Yet, extending this capability to mobile manipulators is hindered by unbounded workspaces and tighter base-arm coupling. We lift this promise to mobile manipulation with Generalized Configuration Space Distance Fields (GCDF), extending CDF to robots with both translational and rotational joints in unbounded workspaces with tighter base-arm coupling. We prove that GCDF preserves Euclidean-like local distance structure and accurately encodes whole-body geometry in configuration space, and develop a data generation and training pipeline that yields continuous neural GCDFs with accurate values and gradients, supporting efficient GPU-batched queries. Building on this representation, we develop a high-performance sequential convex optimization framework centered on GCDF-based collision reasoning. The solver scales to large numbers of implicit constraints through (i) online specification of neural constraints, (ii) sparsity-aware active-set detection with parallel batched evaluation across thousands of constraints, and (iii) incremental constraint management for rapid replanning under scene changes."}

Foot slip is a major source of estimation error: when slip occurs, kinematic measurements violate the no-slip assumption and inject bias during the update step. Our objective is to estimate this slip-induced error and compensate for it. To this end, we augment an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) with a neural compensator that uses an attention mechanism to infer error conditioned on foot-slip severity and then applies this estimate as a post-update compensation to the InEKF state (i.e., after the filter update). The compensator is trained in a latent space, which aims to reduce sensitivity to raw input scales and encourages structured slip-conditioned compensations, while preserving the InEKF recursion. Experiments demonstrate improved performance compared to existing legged-robot state estimators, particularly under slip-prone conditions."}

However, previous methods mainly focused on environment-level visual real-to-sim transfer, ignoring the transfer of interactions, which could be challenging and inefficient to obtain purely in simulation especially for contact-rich tasks. We propose ExoGS, a robot-free 4D Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that captures both static environments and dynamic interactions in the real world and transfers them seamlessly to a simulated environment. It provides a new solution for scalable manipulation data collection and policy learning. ExoGS employs a self-designed robot-isomorphic passive exoskeleton AirExo-3 to capture kinematically consistent trajectories with millimeter-level accuracy and synchronized RGB observations during direct human demonstrations. The robot, objects, and environment are reconstructed as editable 3D Gaussian Splatting assets, enabling geometry-consistent replay and large-scale data augmentation. Additionally, a lightweight Mask Adapter injects instance-level semantics into the policy to enhance robustness under visual domain shifts. Real-world experiments demonstrate that ExoGS significantly improves data efficiency and policy generalization compared to teleoperation-based baselines.

However, evaluation methodologies have lagged behind, hindering the establishment of Trustworthy Evaluation for these behaviors. Current paradigms rely on binary success rates, failing to address the critical dimensions of trust: Source Authenticity (i.e., distinguishing genuine policy behaviors from human teleoperation) and Execution Quality (e.g., smoothness and safety). To bridge these gaps, we propose a solution that combines the Eval-Actions benchmark and the AutoEval architecture. First, we construct the Eval-Actions benchmark to support trustworthiness analysis. Distinct from existing datasets restricted to successful human demonstrations, Eval-Actions integrates VA and VLA policy execution trajectories alongside human teleoperation data, explicitly including failure scenarios. This dataset is structured around three core supervision signals: Expert Grading (EG), Rank-Guided preferences (RG), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Building on this, we propose the AutoEval architecture: AutoEval leverages Spatio-Temporal Aggregation for semantic assessment, augmented by an auxiliary Kinematic Calibration Signal to refine motion smoothness; AutoEval Plus (AutoEval-P) incorporates the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) paradigm to enhance logical reasoning capabilities. Experiments show AutoEval achieves Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficients (SRCC) of 0.81 and 0.84 under the EG and RG protocols, respectively. Crucially, the framework possesses robust source discrimination capabilities, distinguishing between policy-generated and teleoperated videos with 99.6% accuracy, thereby establishing a rigorous standard for trustworthy robotic evaluation.

However, existing FDR frameworks exhibit various limitations, such as significant delays in communication and computation, and unreliability in robot motion/trajectory generation, mainly because the communication-computation-control (3C) loop is designed without considering the downstream FDR goal. To address this, we propose a novel Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) framework that jointly designs the 3C loop tailored for fast and robust robotic FDR, with the goal of minimising the FDR time while maximising the robotic task (e.g., workpiece sorting) success rate. For fault detection, our GoC framework innovatively defines and extracts the 3D scene graph (3D-SG) as the semantic representation via our designed representation extractor, and detects faults by monitoring spatial relationship changes in the 3D-SG. For fault recovery, we fine-tune a small language model (SLM) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and enhance its reasoning and generalization capabilities via knowledge distillation to generate recovery motions for robots. We also design a lightweight goal-oriented digital twin reconstruction module to refine the recovery motions generated by the SLM when fine-grained robotic control is required, using only task-relevant object contours for digital twin reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our GoC framework reduces the FDR time by up to 82.6% and improves the task success rate by up to 76%, compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks that rely on vision language models for fault detection and large language models for fault recovery."}
