Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these\nspaces is relevant to coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure\nfor dense populations. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and robotic\nexperiments to study how noisy motion can disrupt traffic jams and enable flow\nas agents travel to individual goals. Above a critical noise level, large jams\ndo not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the goal\nattainment rate as a function of the noise level, then solve for the optimal\nagent density and noise level that maximize the swarm's goal attainment rate.\nWe perform robotic experiments to corroborate our simulated and theoretical\nresults. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a\nsophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive\nscheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally\nefficient than a planner, suggesting lessons for real-world problems."}
