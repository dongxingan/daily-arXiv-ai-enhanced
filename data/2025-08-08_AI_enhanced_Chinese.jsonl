The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot.

Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service\nrobot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic\narm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes\nmanually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess\ngeneralization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task\ncompletion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To\nsupport comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic\nstrategies and map-based planning.
