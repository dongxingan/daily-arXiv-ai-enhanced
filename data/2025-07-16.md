Abstract: Merging onto a highway is a complex driving task that requires identifying a
safe gap, adjusting speed, often interactions to create a merging gap, and
completing the merge maneuver within a limited time window while maintaining
safety and driving comfort. In this paper, we introduce a Safe Merging and
Real-Time Merge (SMART-Merge) planner, a lattice-based motion planner designed
to facilitate safe and comfortable forced merging. By deliberately adapting
cost terms to the unique challenges of forced merging and introducing a desired
speed heuristic, SMART-Merge planner enables the ego vehicle to merge
successfully while minimizing the merge time. We verify the efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed merge planner through high-fidelity CarMaker
simulations on hundreds of highway merge scenarios. Our proposed planner
achieves the success rate of 100% as well as completes the merge maneuver in
the shortest amount of time compared with the baselines, demonstrating our
planner's capability to handle complex forced merge tasks and provide a
reliable and robust solution for autonomous highway merge. The simulation

Motivation: 解决机器人在复杂、不确定环境中高效运动规划的挑战。

Method: 结合双摄像头感知与基于B样条的模型预测控制（MPC），逐步优化环境模型和运动规划。

Result: 实验验证了框架在不确定性和杂乱环境中的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该框架为机器人在复杂环境中的实时运动规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This letter presents a novel coarse-to-fine motion planning framework for
robotic manipulation in cluttered, unmodeled environments. The system
integrates a dual-camera perception setup with a B-spline-based model
predictive control (MPC) scheme. Initially, the planner generates feasible
global trajectories from partial and uncertain observations. As new visual data
are incrementally fused, both the environment model and motion planning are
progressively refined. A vision-based cost function promotes target-driven
exploration, while a refined kernel-perceptron collision detector enables
efficient constraint updates for real-time planning. The framework accommodates
closed-chain kinematics and supports dynamic replanning. Experiments on a
multi-arm platform validate its robustness and adaptability under uncertainties
and clutter.

Abstract: This paper presents a diffusion-augmented reinforcement learning (RL)
approach for robust autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) control, addressing key
challenges in underwater trajectory planning and dynamic environment
adaptation. The proposed method integrates three core innovations: (1) A
diffusion-based trajectory generation framework that produces physically
feasible multi-step trajectories, enhanced by a high-dimensional state encoding
mechanism combining current observations with historical states and actions
through a novel diffusion U-Net architecture, significantly improving
long-horizon planning. (2) A sample-efficient hybrid learning architecture that
synergizes diffusion-guided exploration with RL policy optimization, where the
diffusion model generates diverse candidate actions and the RL critic selects
optimal actions, achieving higher exploration efficiency and policy stability
in dynamic underwater environments. Extensive simulation experiments validating
the method's superior robustness and flexibility, outperforms conventional
control methods in challenging marine conditions, offering enhanced
adaptability and reliability for AUV operations in the underwater tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a state-estimation solution for legged robots that uses a
set of low-cost, compact, and lightweight sensors to achieve low-drift pose and
velocity estimation under challenging locomotion conditions. The key idea is to
leverage multiple inertial measurement units on different links of the robot to
correct a major error source in standard proprioceptive odometry. We fuse the
inertial sensor information and joint encoder measurements in an extended
Kalman filter, then combine the velocity estimate from this filter with camera
data in a factor-graph-based sliding-window estimator to form a
visual-inertial-leg odometry method. We validate our state estimator through
comprehensive theoretical analysis and hardware experiments performed using
real-world robot data collected during a variety of challenging locomotion
tasks. Our algorithm consistently achieves minimal position deviation, even in
scenarios involving substantial ground impact, foot slippage, and sudden body
rotations. A C++ implementation, along with a large-scale dataset, is available
at https://github.com/ShuoYangRobotics/Cerberus2.0.

### [5] [Learning to Move in Rhythm: Task-Conditioned Motion Policies with Orbital Stability Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10602)
*Maximilian Stölzle,T. Konstantin Rusch,Zach J. Patterson,Rodrigo Pérez-Dattari,Francesco Stella,Josie Hughes,Cosimo Della Santina,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OSMPs的新框架，用于从演示中学习周期性运动，同时保证轨道稳定性和横向收缩性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic Motion Primitives在捕捉复杂周期性行为和任务间插值方面存在局限性，限制了其实际应用范围。

Method: 结合学习到的微分同胚编码器和超临界Hopf分岔，实现了周期性运动的准确学习，并通过任务条件化的双射编码器支持多任务表示。

Result: 在多种机器人平台上验证了OSMPs的优越性，表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: OSMPs为周期性运动学习提供了稳定且通用的解决方案，扩展了机器人学习的应用范围。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration provides a sample-efficient approach to acquiring
complex behaviors, enabling robots to move robustly, compliantly, and with
fluidity. In this context, Dynamic Motion Primitives offer built - in stability
and robustness to disturbances but often struggle to capture complex periodic
behaviors. Moreover, they are limited in their ability to interpolate between
different tasks. These shortcomings substantially narrow their applicability,
excluding a wide class of practically meaningful tasks such as locomotion and
rhythmic tool use. In this work, we introduce Orbitally Stable Motion
Primitives (OSMPs) - a framework that combines a learned diffeomorphic encoder
with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in latent space, enabling the accurate
acquisition of periodic motions from demonstrations while ensuring formal
guarantees of orbital stability and transverse contraction. Furthermore, by
conditioning the bijective encoder on the task, we enable a single learned
policy to represent multiple motion objectives, yielding consistent zero-shot
generalization to unseen motion objectives within the training distribution. We
validate the proposed approach through extensive simulation and real-world
experiments across a diverse range of robotic platforms - from collaborative
arms and soft manipulators to a bio-inspired rigid-soft turtle robot -
demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines such as diffusion policies, among others.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models represent a transformative shift in
robotics, with the aim of unifying visual perception, natural language
understanding, and embodied control within a single learning framework. This
review presents a comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of the VLA
paradigm, with a particular emphasis on robotic manipulation and
instruction-driven autonomy. We comprehensively analyze 102 VLA models, 26
foundational datasets, and 12 simulation platforms that collectively shape the
development and evaluation of VLAs models. These models are categorized into
key architectural paradigms, each reflecting distinct strategies for
integrating vision, language, and control in robotic systems. Foundational
datasets are evaluated using a novel criterion based on task complexity,
variety of modalities, and dataset scale, allowing a comparative analysis of
their suitability for generalist policy learning. We introduce a
two-dimensional characterization framework that organizes these datasets based
on semantic richness and multimodal alignment, showing underexplored regions in
the current data landscape. Simulation environments are evaluated for their
effectiveness in generating large-scale data, as well as their ability to
facilitate transfer from simulation to real-world settings and the variety of
supported tasks. Using both academic and industrial contributions, we recognize
ongoing challenges and outline strategic directions such as scalable
pretraining protocols, modular architectural design, and robust multimodal
alignment strategies. This review serves as both a technical reference and a
conceptual roadmap for advancing embodiment and robotic control, providing
insights that span from dataset generation to real world deployment of
generalist robotic agents.

Conclusion: 软生长机器人可作为有效的非结构化环境探索和地图绘制工具。

Abstract: Passive deformation due to compliance is a commonly used benefit of soft
robots, providing opportunities to achieve robust actuation with few active
degrees of freedom. Soft growing robots in particular have shown promise in
navigation of unstructured environments due to their passive deformation. If
their collisions and subsequent deformations can be better understood, soft
robots could be used to understand the structure of the environment from direct
tactile measurements. In this work, we propose the use of soft growing robots
as mapping and exploration tools. We do this by first characterizing collision
behavior during discrete turns, then leveraging this model to develop a
geometry-based simulator that models robot trajectories in 2D environments.
Finally, we demonstrate the model and simulator validity by mapping unknown
environments using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the optimal next deployment
given current knowledge. Over both uniform and non-uniform environments, this
selection method rapidly approaches ideal actions, showing the potential for
soft growing robots in unstructured environment exploration and mapping.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RCG的场景生成框架，通过整合碰撞语义到对抗扰动流程中，生成更真实的高风险驾驶场景，提升自动驾驶系统的测试效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实驾驶数据中安全关键场景稀缺，难以有效训练和评估自动驾驶系统。

Method: 结合对比预训练和微调，构建安全感知行为表示，嵌入基于真实事故行为的语义结构，改进现有场景生成流程。

Result: 实验显示，使用生成场景训练的自动驾驶系统下游成功率平均提升9.2%，且生成的对抗行为更真实。

Conclusion: RCG框架能生成更真实的高风险场景，有效提升自动驾驶系统的压力测试效果。

Abstract: Safety-critical scenarios are essential for training and evaluating
autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet remain extremely rare in real-world
driving datasets. To address this, we propose Real-world Crash Grounding (RCG),
a scenario generation framework that integrates crash-informed semantics into
adversarial perturbation pipelines. We construct a safety-aware behavior
representation through contrastive pre-training on large-scale driving logs,
followed by fine-tuning on a small, crash-rich dataset with approximate
trajectory annotations extracted from video. This embedding captures semantic
structure aligned with real-world accident behaviors and supports selection of
adversary trajectories that are both high-risk and behaviorally realistic. We
incorporate the resulting selection mechanism into two prior scenario
generation pipelines, replacing their handcrafted scoring objectives with an
embedding-based criterion. Experimental results show that ego agents trained
against these generated scenarios achieve consistently higher downstream
success rates, with an average improvement of 9.2% across seven evaluation
settings. Qualitative and quantitative analyses further demonstrate that our
approach produces more plausible and nuanced adversary behaviors, enabling more
effective and realistic stress testing of AD systems. Code and tools will be
released publicly.

### [9] [rt-RISeg: Real-Time Model-Free Robot Interactive Segmentation for Active Instance-Level Object Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10776)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时交互感知框架rt-RISeg，通过机器人交互和设计的体帧不变特征（BFIF）连续分割未见物体，无需学习分割模型，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有未见物体实例分割（UOIS）方法依赖大规模数据集训练，容易过拟合静态视觉特征，泛化性能差。

Method: 基于视觉交互性原理，提出rt-RISeg框架，利用机器人交互和体帧不变特征（BFIF）实时分割物体。

Result: 平均分割准确率比现有UOIS方法高27.5%，且生成的分割掩码可作为视觉基础模型的提示提升性能。

Conclusion: rt-RISeg通过交互感知显著提升了未见物体的分割性能，且具有独立性和扩展性。

Abstract: Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new
environments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment
unseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen
object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which
often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results
in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution
scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the
principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We
propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that
continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a
designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative
rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting
from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any
learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline
generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot
interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the
effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an
average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art
UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show
that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to
vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.

Main category: cs.RO

Conclusion: 该方法通过预训练模型和目标条件强化学习的结合，显著提升了机器人抓取的通用性和效率。

Abstract: General-purpose robotic manipulation, including reach and grasp, is essential
for deployment into households and workspaces involving diverse and evolving
tasks. Recent advances propose using large pre-trained models, such as Large
Language Models and object detectors, to boost robotic perception in
reinforcement learning. These models, trained on large datasets via
self-supervised learning, can process text prompts and identify diverse objects
in scenes, an invaluable skill in RL where learning object interaction is
resource-intensive. This study demonstrates how to integrate such models into
Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning to enable general and versatile robotic
reach and grasp capabilities. We use a pre-trained object detection model to
enable the agent to identify the object from a text prompt and generate a mask
for goal conditioning. Mask-based goal conditioning provides object-agnostic
cues, improving feature sharing and generalization. The effectiveness of the
proposed framework is demonstrated in a simulated reach-and-grasp task, where
the mask-based goal conditioning consistently maintains a $\sim$90\% success
rate in grasping both in and out-of-distribution objects, while also ensuring
faster convergence to higher returns.

Motivation: 凸集图（GCS）为混合离散-连续规划问题提供了一种统一的建模语言，但缺乏高效的求解方法。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在碰撞避免运动规划、技能链和混合系统最优控制中的高效性和通用性。

Conclusion: GCS中的SWP为多种机器人规划问题提供了统一且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the Shortest-Walk Problem (SWP) in a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS). A
GCS is a graph where each vertex is paired with a convex program, and each edge
couples adjacent programs via additional costs and constraints. A walk in a GCS
is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, where vertices may be repeated.
The length of a walk is given by the cumulative optimal value of the
corresponding convex programs. To solve the SWP in GCS, we first synthesize a
piecewise-quadratic lower bound on the problem's cost-to-go function using
semidefinite programming. Then we use this lower bound to guide an
incremental-search algorithm that yields an approximate shortest walk. We show
that the SWP in GCS is a natural language for many mixed discrete-continuous
planning problems in robotics, unifying problems that typically require
specialized solutions while delivering high performance and computational
efficiency. We demonstrate this through experiments in collision-free motion
planning, skill chaining, and optimal control of hybrid systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前移动机械臂框架通常将导航和操作解耦，导致导航不精确时性能下降，尤其是在角度偏差情况下。为提升任务的多方向执行能力，提出了新方法。

Method: 基于SAM2的对象中心方法，将操作方向信息融入模型，实现任务在不同方向下的一致性理解。

Result: 在自定义移动机械臂上部署模型，通过拾取放置任务测试，相比Action Chunking Transformer，新模型在多样化角度下表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模仿学习在移动机械臂任务中的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Imitation learning for mobile manipulation is a key challenge in the field of
robotic manipulation. However, current mobile manipulation frameworks typically
decouple navigation and manipulation, executing manipulation only after
reaching a certain location. This can lead to performance degradation when
navigation is imprecise, especially due to misalignment in approach angles. To
enable a mobile manipulator to perform the same task from diverse orientations,
an essential capability for building general-purpose robotic models, we propose
an object-centric method based on SAM2, a foundation model towards solving
promptable visual segmentation in images, which incorporates manipulation
orientation information into our model. Our approach enables consistent
understanding of the same task from different orientations. We deploy the model
on a custom-built mobile manipulator and evaluate it on a pick-and-place task
under varied orientation angles. Compared to Action Chunking Transformer, our
model maintains superior generalization when trained with demonstrations from
varied approach angles. This work significantly enhances the generalization and
robustness of imitation learning-based mobile manipulation systems.

Conclusion: 结论表明M-GAPS在硬件实践中具有高效性和灵活性，优于经典自适应控制和模型自由强化学习。

Abstract: We study online algorithms to tune the parameters of a robot controller in a
setting where the dynamics, policy class, and optimality objective are all
time-varying. The system follows a single trajectory without episodes or state
resets, and the time-varying information is not known in advance. Focusing on
nonlinear geometric quadrotor controllers as a test case, we propose a
practical implementation of a single-trajectory model-based online policy
optimization algorithm, M-GAPS,along with reparameterizations of the quadrotor
state space and policy class to improve the optimization landscape. In hardware
experiments,we compare to model-based and model-free baselines that impose
artificial episodes. We show that M-GAPS finds near-optimal parameters more
quickly, especially when the episode length is not favorable. We also show that
M-GAPS rapidly adapts to heavy unmodeled wind and payload disturbances, and
achieves similar strong improvement on a 1:6-scale Ackermann-steered car. Our
results demonstrate the hardware practicality of this emerging class of online
policy optimization that offers significantly more flexibility than classic
adaptive control, while being more stable and data-efficient than model-free
reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了MeSCRs的运动性能，优化方法适用于多种设计场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling and optimization framework to enhance
the kinematic performance of multi-magnet embedded soft continuum robots
(MeSCRs). To this end, we establish a differentiable system formulation based
on an extended pseudo-rigid-body model. This formulation enables analysis of
the equilibrium well-posedness and the geometry of the induced configuration
under magnetic actuation. In particular, we show that the maximum controllable
degrees of freedom of a MeSCR equal twice the number of embedded magnets. We
subsequently develop a structural optimization framework based on differential
geometry that links classical kinematic measures (e.g., manipulability and
dexterity) to the configuration of embedded magnets. The resulting optimization
condition reveals that improving local performance requires structurally
modulating the spectrum of the configuration space metric to counteract its
distortion. Closed-form solutions for optimal magnet configurations are derived
under representative conditions, and a gradient-based numerical method is
proposed for general design scenarios. Simulation studies validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的多任务学习框架，用于提升社交机器人在多用户环境中的决策能力，通过两种新的损失函数和新的数据集，实现了最先进的响应决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多用户环境中，社交机器人需要理解上下文并决定何时及向谁响应，而现有研究主要关注单用户交互。

Method: 采用Transformer多任务学习框架，提出两种新损失函数：一种约束主动说话者以改进场景建模，另一种引导响应选择针对机器人的话语。构建了新的多用户HRI数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在响应决策上优于现有的启发式和单任务方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 研究为开发具有社交智能的机器人提供了支持，使其能够进行自然且上下文感知的多方交互。

Abstract: Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on
single-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or
recipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at
malls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both
when and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a
Transformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making
process of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering
the characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that
enforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another
that guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the
robot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures
real-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond
decisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches.
Our findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social
robots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party
interactions.

Method: 采用分层策略：高层视觉规划器（Diff-EDF）和低层顺应性视觉运动策略（G-CompACT），结合局部观测和SE(3)-等变性设计。

Result: 在真实PiH任务中实现接近完美的成功率，并对未见空间配置表现出鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: EquiContact框架及其设计原则（顺应性、局部策略和等变性）有效提升了接触密集型任务的空间泛化性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for learning vision-based robotic policies
for contact-rich manipulation tasks that generalize spatially across task
configurations. We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the
policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of
demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a
high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF)
and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT,
G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically
consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB
images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these
design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is
SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key
components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance,
localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH
tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to
unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and
principles. The experimental videos can be found on the project website:

Result: 在受限水池和Trondheim峡湾的码头进行了实验，展示了不确定性在可视化中的变化。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了水下机器人环境表示的不确定性管理能力。

Abstract: Vision-based underwater robots can be useful in inspecting and exploring
confined spaces where traditional sensors and preplanned paths cannot be
followed. Sensor noise and situational change can cause significant uncertainty
in environmental representation. Thus, this paper explores how to represent
mapping inconsistency in vision-based sensing and incorporate depth estimation
confidence into the mapping framework. The scene depth and the confidence are
estimated using the RAFT-Stereo model and are integrated into a voxel-based
mapping framework, Voxblox. Improvements in the existing Voxblox weight
calculation and update mechanism are also proposed. Finally, a qualitative
analysis of the proposed method is performed in a confined pool and in a pier
in the Trondheim fjord. Experiments using an underwater robot demonstrated the
change in uncertainty in the visualization.

Motivation: 解决从演示中学习时间约束以复现逻辑约束行为的挑战性问题。

Method: 结合遗传算法的时间逻辑挖掘（GA-TL-Mining）和逻辑约束强化学习（Logic-CRL），通过零和博弈框架学习时间约束。

Result: 在四个时间约束任务上优于现有方法，并成功迁移到现实任务中。

Conclusion: ILCL方法有效解决了时间约束学习问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of temporal-constraint learning from
demonstrations to reproduce demonstration-like logic-constrained behaviors.
Learning logic constraints is challenging due to the combinatorially large
space of possible specifications and the ill-posed nature of non-Markovian
constraints. To figure it out, we introduce a novel temporal-constraint
learning method, which we call inverse logic-constraint learning (ILCL). Our
method frames ICL as a two-player zero-sum game between 1) a genetic
algorithm-based temporal-logic mining (GA-TL-Mining) and 2) logic-constrained
reinforcement learning (Logic-CRL). GA-TL-Mining efficiently constructs syntax
trees for parameterized truncated linear temporal logic (TLTL) without
predefined templates. Subsequently, Logic-CRL finds a policy that maximizes
task rewards under the constructed TLTL constraints via a novel constraint
redistribution scheme. Our evaluations show ILCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in learning and transferring TL constraints on four temporally
constrained tasks. We also demonstrate successful transfer to real-world
peg-in-shallow-hole tasks.

Motivation: 传统导航系统在动态和非结构化环境中泛化能力差，导致性能下降和社会接受度降低。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型推理和条件变分自编码器，结合单样本示例和思维链提示策略，实现超参数自适应调优。

Conclusion: LE-Nav通过场景感知和自适应调优，显著提升了导航性能和社会接受度。

Abstract: Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments,
where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across
locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that
rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting
in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent
approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional
planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor
generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective
sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an
interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal
large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to
adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene
understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the
mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters,
enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate
hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and
scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair
platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort,
while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social
acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/LE-Nav.

Abstract: This study presents an advanced approach to enhance robotic manipulation in
uncertain and challenging environments, with a focus on autonomous operations
augmented by human-in-the-loop (HITL) control for lunar missions. By
integrating human decision-making with autonomous robotic functions, the
research improves task reliability and efficiency for space applications. The
key task addressed is the autonomous deployment of flexible solar panels using
an extendable ladder-like structure and a robotic manipulator with real-time
feedback for precision. The manipulator relays position and force-torque data,
enabling dynamic error detection and adaptive control during deployment. To
mitigate the effects of sinkage, variable payload, and low-lighting conditions,
efficient motion planning strategies are employed, supplemented by human
control that allows operators to intervene in ambiguous scenarios. Digital twin
simulation enhances system robustness by enabling continuous feedback,
iterative task refinement, and seamless integration with the deployment
pipeline. The system has been tested to validate its performance in simulated
lunar conditions and ensure reliability in extreme lighting, variable terrain,
changing payloads, and sensor limitations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体的3D几何重建因反射和折射等物理特性而具有挑战性，尤其在稀疏视图和动态环境中。

Method: TRAN-D通过分离透明物体与背景，优化对应高斯分布，并结合物体感知损失和物理模拟，减少伪影并提升重建精度。

Result: 在合成和真实场景中，TRAN-D比现有方法平均绝对误差降低39%，单图像更新时精度提升1.5倍。

Conclusion: TRAN-D在透明物体深度重建中表现出色，尤其在稀疏视图和动态环境下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is
challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and
refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse
views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian
Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key
insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling
focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate
artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,
ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.
Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the
reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and
chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.
TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it
consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based
state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean
absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,
despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm
accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

Abstract: Derivatives of equations of motion(EOM) describing the dynamics of rigid body
systems are becoming increasingly relevant for the robotics community and find
many applications in design and control of robotic systems. Controlling robots,
and multibody systems comprising elastic components in particular, not only
requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control
forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of
the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the
existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight
into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body
systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.

Conclusion: 机器人系统在估计组织生物力学特性方面表现出潜力，为未来临床诊断应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Diagnostic activities, such as ultrasound scans and palpation, are relatively
low-cost. They play a crucial role in the early detection of health problems
and in assessing their progression. However, they are also error-prone
activities, which require highly skilled medical staff. The use of robotic
solutions can be key to decreasing the inherent subjectivity of the results and
reducing the waiting list. For a robot to perform palpation or ultrasound
scans, it must effectively manage physical interactions with the human body,
which greatly benefits from precise estimation of the patient's tissue
biomechanical properties. This paper assesses the accuracy and precision of a
robotic system in estimating the viscoelastic parameters of various materials,
including some tests on ex vivo tissues as a preliminary proof-of-concept
demonstration of the method's applicability to biological samples. The
measurements are compared against a ground truth derived from silicone
specimens with different viscoelastic properties, characterised using a
high-precision instrument. Experimental results show that the robotic system's
accuracy closely matches the ground truth, increasing confidence in the
potential use of robots for such clinical applications.

Result: 证明了方案能以高概率保证渐近跟踪目标轨迹，并在2自由度平面机器人上进行了数值验证。

Conclusion: 提出的策略有效解决了模型不匹配问题，实现了高精度的轨迹跟踪。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based robust feedback
linearization strategy to ensure precise trajectory tracking for an important
family of Lagrangian systems. We assume a nominal knowledge of the dynamics is
given but no a-priori bounds on the model mismatch are available. In our
approach, the key ingredient is the adoption of a regression framework based on
Gaussian Processes (GPR) to estimate the model mismatch. This estimate is added
to the outer loop of a classical feedback linearization scheme based on the
nominal knowledge available. Then, to compensate for the residual uncertainty,
we robustify the controller including an additional term whose size is designed
based on the variance provided by the GPR framework. We proved that, with high
probability, the proposed scheme is able to guarantee asymptotic tracking of a
desired trajectory. We tested numerically our strategy on a 2 degrees of
freedom planar robot.

Conclusion: 缩小比例车辆可作为自定位算法的有效测试平台，OpenVINS表现最优。

Abstract: Physically reduced-scale vehicles are emerging to accelerate the development
of advanced automated driving functions. In this paper, we investigate the
effects of scaling on self-localization accuracy with visual and
visual-inertial algorithms using cameras and an inertial measurement unit
(IMU). For this purpose, ROS2-compatible visual and visual-inertial algorithms
are selected, and datasets are chosen as a baseline for real-sized vehicles. A
test drive is conducted to record data of reduced-scale vehicles. We compare
the selected localization algorithms, OpenVINS, VINS-Fusion, and RTAB-Map, in
terms of their pose accuracy against the ground-truth and against data from
real-sized vehicles. When comparing the implementation of the selected
localization algorithms to real-sized vehicles, OpenVINS has the lowest average
localization error. Although all selected localization algorithms have
overlapping error ranges, OpenVINS also performs best when applied to a
reduced-scale vehicle. When reduced-scale vehicles were compared to real-sized
vehicles, minor differences were found in translational vehicle motion
estimation accuracy. However, no significant differences were found when
comparing the estimation accuracy of rotational vehicle motion, allowing RSVRs
to be used as testing platforms for self-localization algorithms.

Result: 在两医院场景中，消毒时间分别减少30.7%和31.9%，效果相同。

Conclusion: 该系统显著提升消毒效率，减少低风险区域不必要的紫外线暴露。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected public health, healthcare
systems, and daily life, especially amid resource shortages and limited
workers. This crisis has underscored the urgent need for automation in hospital
environments, particularly disinfection, which is crucial to controlling virus
transmission and improving the safety of healthcare personnel and patients.
Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection, known for its high efficiency, has been
widely adopted in hospital settings. However, most existing research focuses on
maximizing UV coverage while paying little attention to the impact of human
activity on virus distribution. To address this issue, we propose a mobile
robotic system for UV disinfection focusing on the virus hotspot. The system
prioritizes disinfection in high-risk areas and employs an approach for
optimized UV dosage to ensure that all surfaces receive an adequate level of UV
exposure while significantly reducing disinfection time. It not only improves
disinfection efficiency but also minimizes unnecessary exposure in low-risk
areas. In two representative hospital scenarios, our method achieves the same
disinfection effectiveness while reducing disinfection time by 30.7% and 31.9%,
respectively. The video of the experiment is available at:

Motivation: 双手机器人操作在工业自动化和家庭服务中至关重要，但由于高维动作空间和复杂协调需求，存在显著挑战。视频预测在表示学习和控制中的应用潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了一种多帧潜在预测策略，在压缩潜在空间中编码未来状态，并引入单向注意力机制，视频预测依赖于动作，而动作预测独立于视频预测。

Conclusion: 该框架通过联合优化视频和动作预测，显著提升了双手机器人操作的协调性和效率，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is crucial in robotics, enabling complex tasks in
industrial automation and household services. However, it poses significant
challenges due to the high-dimensional action space and intricate coordination
requirements. While video prediction has been recently studied for
representation learning and control, leveraging its ability to capture rich
dynamic and behavioral information, its potential for enhancing bimanual
coordination remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified
diffusion-based framework for the joint optimization of video and action
prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-frame latent prediction strategy
that encodes future states in a compressed latent space, preserving
task-relevant features. Furthermore, we introduce a unidirectional attention
mechanism where video prediction is conditioned on the action, while action
prediction remains independent of video prediction. This design allows us to
omit video prediction during inference, significantly enhancing efficiency.
Experiments on two simulated benchmarks and a real-world setting demonstrate a
significant improvement in the success rate over the strong baseline ACT using
our method, achieving a \textbf{24.9\%} increase on ALOHA, an \textbf{11.1\%}
increase on RoboTwin, and a \textbf{32.5\%} increase in real-world experiments.

Abstract: Vision is an essential part of attitude control for many flying animals, some
of which have no dedicated sense of gravity. Flying robots, on the other hand,
typically depend heavily on accelerometers and gyroscopes for attitude
stabilization. In this work, we present the first vision-only approach to
flight control for use in generic environments. We show that a quadrotor drone
equipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and
rotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without
inertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural
network trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests
demonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network
is capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight
control loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across
different environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.
While networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best
performance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative
generalization. Our work showcases vision-only flight control as a promising
candidate for enabling autonomous, insect-scale flying robots.

Abstract: The RoboCup Logistics League is a RoboCup competition in a smart factory
scenario that has focused on task planning, job scheduling, and multi-agent
coordination. The focus on production logistics allowed teams to develop highly
competitive strategies, but also meant that some recent developments in the
context of smart manufacturing are not reflected in the competition, weakening
its relevance over the years. In this paper, we describe the vision for the
RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League, a new competition designed as a larger
smart manufacturing scenario, reflecting all the major aspects of a modern
factory. It will consist of several tracks that are initially independent but
gradually combined into one smart manufacturing scenario. The new tracks will
cover industrial robotics challenges such as assembly, human-robot
collaboration, and humanoid robotics, but also retain a focus on production
logistics. We expect the reenvisioned competition to be more attractive to
newcomers and well-tried teams, while also shifting the focus to current and
future challenges of industrial robotics.

including the alignment of robotic actions with human surgeon preferences, the
necessity for procedural awareness within autonomous systems, the establishment

Conclusion: 该框架通过分层规划与控制实现了高效、鲁棒的多机器人导航，适用于动态和异步场景。

Abstract: We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation
tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment
information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high
frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing
collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in
multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal
trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their
assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation
from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables
the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an
instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast
state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack
(Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and
versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous
and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick
replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations,
including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target
updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.

Conclusion: 研究表明强化学习能够将人形机器人引入创造性音乐表演领域，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen remarkable advances in dexterity, balance, and
locomotion, yet their role in expressive domains, such as music performance,
remains largely unexplored. Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique
challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb
coordination over pieces lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot
Drummer, a humanoid system capable of expressive, high-precision drumming
across a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as
sequential fulfillment of timed-contacts and transform drum scores in to a
Rhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical
performance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a
single policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning.
Through extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz
tracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high
F1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming
strategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive sticks assignments,
demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots
into the domain of creative musical performance. Project page:

### [34] [LLM-based ambiguity detection in natural language instructions for collaborative surgical robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11525)
*Ana Davila,Jacinto Colan,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的框架，用于检测手术场景中的指令歧义，通过集成多个LLM评估器和共形预测提高分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的歧义在安全关键的人机交互（如手术）中存在风险，需要一种机制提前识别歧义指令以提高安全性。

Method: 采用集成LLM评估器，结合不同提示技术识别多种歧义类型，并通过共形预测合成评估结果。

Result: 在区分手术指令歧义时，Llama 3.2 11B和Gemma 3 12B的分类准确率超过60%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过提前识别歧义指令，提升了手术中人机协作的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language instructions poses significant risks in
safety-critical human-robot interaction, particularly in domains such as
surgery. To address this, we propose a framework that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) for ambiguity detection specifically designed for collaborative
surgical scenarios. Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each
configured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic,
contextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator
is included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential
issues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal
prediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled
calibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed
classification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from
unambiguous surgical instructions. Our approach improves the safety and
reliability of human-robot collaboration in surgery by offering a mechanism to
identify potentially ambiguous instructions before robot action.
