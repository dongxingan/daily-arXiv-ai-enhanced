### [1] [Effective Explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention Robots: When and What to Explain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02016)
*Cong Wang,Roberto Calandra,Verena Klös*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器人在日常任务中如何通过解释其决策过程来减少用户困惑，提出了识别意外行为和构建有效解释的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人执行复杂任务时，用户可能因意外行为感到困惑，需要解释其意图以避免用户不满。

Method: 调查用户对解释需求和内容的偏好，提出两种算法识别意外行为并构建解释。

Result: 用户希望在意外情况下获得解释，偏好简洁明了的意图和上下文信息。

Conclusion: 提出的算法可轻松集成到BDI推理中，改善人机交互。

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives,
deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

### [3] [Towards Bio-Inspired Robotic Trajectory Planning via Self-Supervised RNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02171)
*Miroslav Cibula,Kristína Malinovská,Matthias Kerzel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于认知启发的自监督学习方法，用于机器人轨迹规划，通过循环架构学习生成轨迹，无需依赖模仿学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于采样的轨迹规划方法计算量大，而完全监督的模仿学习方法无法确保轨迹能成功达到目标。因此，需要一种更高效且能自适应学习的方法。

Method: 采用自监督学习方案，基于循环架构构建轨迹模型，利用给定的正向和逆向运动学模型生成轨迹。

Result: 模型能够仅通过给定的运动学模型学习生成轨迹，表明该方法适用于需要自适应解决方案的复杂任务。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督学习方法为复杂机器人操作任务提供了一种高效的轨迹规划解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.

### [4] [cVLA: Towards Efficient Camera-Space VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02190)
*Max Argus,Jelena Bratulic,Houman Masnavi,Maxim Velikanov,Nick Heppert,Abhinav Valada,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的新型VLA方法，直接预测机器人末端执行器的轨迹点，训练高效且与机器人无关。


<details>

Result: 模型在仿真和真实数据上均表现优异，具有强仿真到现实的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、轻量且通用，适用于复杂机器人操作任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling
complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In
this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive
performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer
robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models
that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making
it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its
lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns
meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the
underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time
techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action
generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong
sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination
of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic
system.

Abstract: Simulators are useful tools for testing automated driving controllers.
Vehicle-in-the-loop (ViL) tests and digital twins (DTs) are widely used
simulation technologies to facilitate the smooth deployment of controllers to
physical vehicles. However, conventional ViL tests rely on full-size vehicles,
requiring large space and high expenses. Also, physical-model-based DT suffers
from the reality gap caused by modeling imprecision. This paper develops a
comprehensive and practical simulator for testing automated driving controllers
enhanced by scaled physical cars and AI-powered DT models. The scaled cars
allow for saving space and expenses of simulation tests. The AI-powered DT
models ensure superior simulation fidelity. Moreover, the simulator integrates
well with off-the-shelf software and control algorithms, making it easy to
extend. We use a filtered control benchmark with formal safety guarantees to
showcase the capability of the simulator in validating automated driving
controllers. Experimental studies are performed to showcase the efficacy of the
simulator, implying its great potential in validating control solutions for
autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic.

### [6] [GPS-DRIFT: Marine Surface Robot Localization using IMU-GPS Fusion and Invariant Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02198)
*Surya Pratap Singh,Tsimafei Lazouski,Maani Ghaffari*

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航向估计在无GPS情况下的不可观测性问题，提供漂移无关的定位和可靠的方向估计。

Method: 基于不变扩展卡尔曼滤波（InEKF），开发对称保持传感器融合管道，结合GPS地面航向信息与IMU方向。

Result: 在BlueBoat上验证，提供开源解决方案，适用于GPS信号差的环境。

Conclusion: 为未来实验和比较研究奠定基础，提供高精度航向观测和定位方法。

Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the DRIFT invariant state estimation
framework, enabling robust fusion of GPS and IMU data for accurate pose and
heading estimation. Originally developed for testing and usage on a marine
autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), this approach can also be utilized on other
mobile systems. Building upon the original proprioceptive only DRIFT algorithm,
we develop a symmetry-preserving sensor fusion pipeline utilizing the invariant
extended Kalman filter (InEKF) to integrate global position updates from GPS
directly into the correction step. Crucially, we introduce a novel heading
correction mechanism that leverages GPS course-over-ground information in
conjunction with IMU orientation, overcoming the inherent unobservability of
yaw in dead-reckoning. The system was deployed and validated on a customized
Blue Robotics BlueBoat, but the methodological focus is on the algorithmic
approach to fusing exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors for drift-free
localization and reliable orientation estimation. This work provides an open
source solution for accurate yaw observation and localization in challenging or
GPS-degraded conditions, and lays the groundwork for future experimental and
comparative studies.

### [7] [MISC: Minimal Intervention Shared Control with Guaranteed Safety under Non-Convex Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02438)
*Shivam Chaubey,Francesco Verdoja,Shankar Deka,Ville Kyrki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于约束最优控制问题的辅助控制器框架，通过离线计算的控制不变集确保在线控制的可行性、严格约束满足和最小化用户意图覆盖，解决了现有共享控制方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共享控制方法在可行性、可扩展性或安全性保证方面存在不足，尤其是用户输入不可预测的情况下。

Method: 基于约束最优控制问题框架，结合离线计算的控制不变集，支持在线计算控制动作，并能处理非凸约束。

Result: 通过大规模用户研究验证，该方法在任务负载、信任、感知控制和性能方面均有显著提升，且不牺牲安全性和用户意图。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了共享控制中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Shared control combines human intention with autonomous decision-making, from
low-level safety overrides to high-level task guidance, enabling systems that
adapt to users while ensuring safety and performance. This enhances task
effectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics,
teleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control
methods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or
learning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety
guarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable.
  To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework
based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an
offline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control
actions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal
override of user intent. Moreover, the framework can accommodate structured
class of non-convex constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. We
validate the approach through a large-scale user study with 66
participants--one of the most extensive in shared control research--using a
computer game environment to assess task load, trust, and perceived control, in
addition to performance. The results show consistent improvements across all
these aspects without compromising safety and user intent.

### [10] [Path Planning using a One-shot-sampling Skeleton Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02328)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度去噪自编码器（DDAE）的路径规划方法SkelUnet，用于高效生成骨架化导航地图，平衡路径安全性、长度和响应时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统骨架化算法资源消耗大且面向图像处理，而路径规划需要平衡响应时间、安全性和路径长度。

Method: 利用基于U-Net架构的DDAE（SkelUnet）生成骨架化地图，结合一次性采样（OSS）探索工作空间。

Result: 在12,500张地图上训练和测试，250张未见地图上验证，SkelUnet显著提升路径安全性、连通性和处理效率。

Conclusion: SkelUnet适用于结构化环境中的移动服务机器人，提供高效、安全的路径规划。

Abstract: Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.

Abstract: In the future, mobility will be strongly shaped by the increasing use of
digitalization. Not only will individual road users be highly interconnected,
but also the road and associated infrastructure. At that point, a Digital Twin
becomes particularly appealing because, unlike a basic simulation, it offers a
continuous, bilateral connection linking the real and virtual environments.
This paper describes the digital reconstruction used to develop the Digital
Twin of the Test Area Autonomous Driving-Baden-W\"urttemberg (TAF-BW), Germany.
The TAF-BW offers a variety of different road sections, from high-traffic urban
intersections and tunnels to multilane motorways. The test area is equipped
with a comprehensive Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication infrastructure
and multiple intelligent intersections equipped with camera sensors to
facilitate real-time traffic flow monitoring. The generation of authentic data
as input for the Digital Twin was achieved by extracting object lists at the
intersections. This process was facilitated by the combined utilization of
camera images from the intelligent infrastructure and LiDAR sensors mounted on
a test vehicle. Using a unified interface, recordings from real-world
detections of traffic participants can be resimulated. Additionally, the
simulation framework's design and the reconstruction process is discussed. The
resulting framework is made publicly available for download and utilization at:
https://digit4taf-bw.fzi.de The demonstration uses two case studies to
illustrate the application of the digital twin and its interfaces: the analysis
of traffic signal systems to optimize traffic flow and the simulation of
security-related scenarios in the communications sector.

Conclusion: 该框架为高效、可扩展的多智能体融合设定了新标准，有效应对实际协作感知挑战。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

Result: 仿真和实验表明，该方法在鲁棒性、能效和安全性上优于现有RL控制器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过顺应性动作模块有效平衡了鲁棒性和顺应性，提升了四足机器人的性能。

Abstract: Despite recent remarkable achievements in quadruped control, it remains
challenging to ensure robust and compliant locomotion in the presence of
unforeseen external disturbances. Existing methods prioritize locomotion
robustness over compliance, often leading to stiff, high-frequency motions, and
energy inefficiency. This paper, therefore, presents a two-stage hierarchical
learning framework that can learn to take active reactions to external force
disturbances based on force estimation. In the first stage, a velocity-tracking
policy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical
proprioceptive features. A neural network-based estimator is learned through
supervised learning, which estimates body velocity and external forces based on
proprioceptive measurements. In the second stage, a compliance action module,
inspired by impedance control, is learned based on the pre-trained encoder and
policy. This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in
response to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the
compliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor
disturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking
a balance between robustness and compliance. Simulations and real-world
experiments have demonstrated that our method has superior performance in terms
of robustness, energy efficiency, and safety. Experiment comparison shows that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based locomotion controllers.
Ablation studies are given to show the critical roles of the compliance action
module.

Abstract: Under-actuated compliant robotic systems offer a promising approach to

untethered, centimeter-scale quadrupedal robot inspired by compliant
under-actuated mechanisms. Flix-Walker employs flexible, helix-shaped beams as
legs, which are actuated by vibrations from just two motors to achieve three
distinct mobility modes. We analyze the actuation parameters required to
generate various locomotion modes through both simulation and prototype
experiments. The effects of system and environmental variations on locomotion
performance are examined, and we propose a generic metric for selecting control
parameters that produce robust and functional motions. Experiments validate the
effectiveness and robustness of these actuation parameters within a closed-loop
control framework, demonstrating reliable trajectory-tracking and
self-navigation capabilities.

Abstract: Articulated object manipulation remains a critical challenge in robotics due
to the complex kinematic constraints and the limited physical reasoning of
existing methods. In this work, we introduce ArtGS, a novel framework that
extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by integrating visual-physical modeling
for articulated object understanding and interaction. ArtGS begins with
multi-view RGB-D reconstruction, followed by reasoning with a vision-language
model (VLM) to extract semantic and structural information, particularly the
articulated bones. Through dynamic, differentiable 3DGS-based rendering, ArtGS
optimizes the parameters of the articulated bones, ensuring physically
consistent motion constraints and enhancing the manipulation policy. By
leveraging dynamic Gaussian splatting, cross-embodiment adaptability, and
closed-loop optimization, ArtGS establishes a new framework for efficient,
scalable, and generalizable articulated object modeling and manipulation.
Experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments
demonstrate that ArtGS significantly outperforms previous methods in joint
estimation accuracy and manipulation success rates across a variety of
articulated objects. Additional images and videos are available on the project

Abstract: Robotic grasping faces challenges in adapting to objects with varying shapes
and sizes. In this paper, we introduce MISCGrasp, a volumetric grasping method
that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature
enhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction
between high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer,
while the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level
features, which synergistically strikes a balance between focusing on fine
geometric details and overall geometric structures. Furthermore, MISCGrasp
utilizes multi-scale contrastive learning to exploit similarities among
positive grasp samples, ensuring consistency across multi-scale features.
Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate
that MISCGrasp outperforms baseline and variant methods in tabletop
decluttering tasks. More details are available at https://miscgrasp.github.io/.

Abstract: In disaster response scenarios, deploying robotic teams effectively is
crucial for improving situational awareness and enhancing search and rescue
operations. The use of robots in search and rescue has been studied but the
question of where to start robot deployments has not been addressed. This work
addresses the problem of optimally selecting starting locations for robots with
heterogeneous capabilities by formulating a joint optimization problem. To
determine start locations, this work adds a constraint to the ergodic
optimization framework whose minimum assigns robots to start locations. This
becomes a little more challenging when the robots are heterogeneous (equipped
with different sensing and motion modalities) because not all robots start at
the same location, and a more complex adaptation of the aforementioned
constraint is applied. Our method assumes access to potential starting
locations, which can be obtained from expert knowledge or aerial imagery. We
experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our joint optimization approach by
comparing it to baseline methods that use fixed starting locations for all
robots. Our experimental results show significant gains in coverage
performance, with average improvements of 35.98% on synthetic data and 31.91%
on real-world data for homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, in terms of the
ergodic metric.

Abstract: We present an efficient hierarchical motion planning pipeline for

multiple collisionfree and topologically distinct paths for the mobile base to
extract the space in which optimal solutions may exist. Further sampling and

nonholonomic dynamics while ensuring optimality.

Abstract: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the
real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains
challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has
benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be
notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has
succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still
largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing
MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into
traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase
our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on
multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without
any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world
pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of
generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the
multimodal sim-to-real gap.
