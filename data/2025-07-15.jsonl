Current\nvision-language mapping approaches rely on object-centric segmentation priors,\nwhich often fail outdoors due to semantic ambiguities and indistinct semantic\nclass boundaries.

OTAS overcomes the limitations of open-vocabulary\nsegmentation models by extracting semantic structure directly from the output\ntokens of pretrained vision models. By clustering semantically similar\nstructures across single and multiple views and grounding them in language,\nOTAS reconstructs a geometrically consistent feature field that supports\nopen-vocabulary segmentation queries. Our method operates zero-shot, without\nscene-specific fine-tuning, and runs at up to ~17 fps. OTAS provides a minor\nIoU improvement over fine-tuned and open-vocabulary 2D segmentation methods on\nthe Off-Road Freespace Detection dataset.

Although satellite-based positioning and\ncameras are widely used, they often suffer from limited availability in many\nenvironments.

However, most existing lane-changing\nframeworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to\naccurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study\nproposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework.\nFirst, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully\ncooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs\ninformed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust\nevaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during\nlane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate\ncooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered\nby minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the\npredictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and\ncontext-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment\nconducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.\nResults show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different\nHVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism\nsignificantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and\ncontributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions."}

Path following\nis a typical use case for model predictive control (MPC), but formulating\nconstraints for obstacle avoidance is challenging in this case. Typically the\ncost and constraints of an MPC problem are defined as closed-form functions and\ntypical solvers work best with continuously differentiable functions. This is\ncontrary to spatially discrete occupancy grid maps, in which a grid's value\ndefines the cost associated with occupancy. This paper presents a way to\novercome this compatibility issue by re-formulating occupancy grid maps to\ncontinuously differentiable functions to be embedded into the MPC scheme as\nconstraints.
