At the same time, autonomous\nrobotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular\ntools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including\nmeasurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context,\nthis paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into\nhow the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design\noptimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We\npropose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement\nmatrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the\nsignal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is\nthe application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying\ntransform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the\nnumber of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution\nmaps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce\nrobot travel distance to less than $10\\%$ of a full-coverage path, while\nimproving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to\ntraditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by\na factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP)\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "论文提出了一种利用压缩感知（CS）矩阵结构优化机器人采样轨迹的方法，结合蒙特卡洛优化和字典学习（DL），显著减少机器人路径长度并提高信号重建精度。", "motivation": "压缩感知在机器人环境数据采集中具有潜力，但如何优化采样轨迹以减少机器人移动距离并提高重建精度尚未充分研究。", "method": "提出蒙特卡洛优化框架，结合字典学习生成优化的CS测量矩阵，最小化机器人路径长度和信号重建误差。", "result": "实验显示，该方法将机器人路径长度减少至全覆盖路径的10%以下，重建精度比传统CS方法提高五倍，比现有IPP方法提高两倍。", "conclusion": "该方法为机器人环境数据采集提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案，显著优于传统方法。"}}
