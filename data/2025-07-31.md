Abstract: Soft everting robots present significant advantages over traditional rigid
robots, including enhanced dexterity, improved environmental interaction, and
safe navigation in unpredictable environments. While soft everting robots have
been widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move
and deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous
work focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation
capabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads
in hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under
debris, would represent a significant capability in many applications. In this
work, we present an analysis of how soft everting robots can be used to deploy
larger, heavier payloads through the inside of the robot. We analyze both what
objects can be deployed and what terrain features they can be carried through.
Building on existing models, we present methods to quantify the effects of
payloads on robot growth and self-support, and develop a model to predict
payload slip. We then experimentally quantify payload transport using soft
everting robot with a variety of payload shapes, sizes, and weights and though
a series of tasks: steering, vertical transport, movement through holes, and
movement across gaps. Overall, the results show that we can transport payloads
in a variety of shapes and up to 1.5kg in weight and that we can move through
circular apertures with as little as 0.01cm clearance around payloads, carry
out discrete turns up to 135 degrees, and move across unsupported gaps of 1.15m
in length.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FLORES是一种新型轮腿机器人，通过独特的腿部设计和强化学习控制器，实现了在平坦和复杂地形上的高效多模态运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轮腿机器人未能充分利用腿和轮的优势，限制了系统的灵活性和效率。FLORES旨在通过创新设计解决这一问题。

Method: FLORES采用前腿髋部偏航自由度替代传统髋部滚动自由度，并结合强化学习控制器优化多模态运动策略。

Result: 实验表明，FLORES在转向能力、导航效率和地形适应性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: FLORES通过创新设计和控制策略，显著提升了轮腿机器人的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Wheel-legged robots integrate the agility of legs for navigating rough
terrains while harnessing the efficiency of wheels for smooth surfaces.
However, most existing designs do not fully capitalize on the benefits of both
legged and wheeled structures, which limits overall system flexibility and
efficiency. We present FLORES (reconfigured wheel-legged robot for enhanced
steering and adaptability), a novel wheel-legged robot design featuring a
distinctive front-leg configuration that sets it beyond standard design
approaches. Specifically, FLORES replaces the conventional hip-roll degree of
freedom (DoF) of the front leg with hip-yaw DoFs, and this allows for efficient
movement on flat surfaces while ensuring adaptability when navigating complex
terrains. This innovative design facilitates seamless transitions between
different locomotion modes (i.e., legged locomotion and wheeled locomotion) and
optimizes the performance across varied environments. To fully exploit FLORES's
mechanical capabilities, we develop a tailored reinforcement learning (RL)
controller that adapts the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) with a customized reward
structure optimized for our unique mechanical configuration. This framework
enables the generation of adaptive, multi-modal locomotion strategies that
facilitate smooth transitions between wheeled and legged movements.
Furthermore, our distinctive joint design enables the robot to exhibit novel
and highly efficient locomotion gaits that capitalize on the synergistic
advantages of both locomotion modes. Through comprehensive experiments, we
demonstrate FLORES's enhanced steering capabilities, improved navigation
efficiency, and versatile locomotion across various terrains. The open-source

### [3] [In-Situ Soil-Property Estimation and Bayesian Mapping with a Simulated Compact Track Loader](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22356)
*W. Jacob Wagner,Ahmet Soylemezoglu,Katherine Driggs-Campbell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种土壤属性映射系统，通过GPU加速和盲映射组件扩展环境状态，以支持更鲁棒的自主土方工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主土方工程受限于复杂车辆-地形交互和部分可观测的土壤条件，需扩展环境状态以提升适应性。

Method: 结合GPU加速高程映射与盲映射组件，利用FEE建模切割力，开发改进的PINN模型预测土壤属性。

Result: 系统能准确识别需要更高交互力的区域，支持土壤感知规划。

Conclusion: 该方法在自主地形塑造中展现出潜力，有望提升土壤感知能力。

Abstract: Existing earthmoving autonomy is largely confined to highly controlled and
well-characterized environments due to the complexity of vehicle-terrain
interaction dynamics and the partial observability of the terrain resulting
from unknown and spatially varying soil conditions. In this chapter, a a
soil-property mapping system is proposed to extend the environmental state, in
order to overcome these restrictions and facilitate development of more robust
autonomous earthmoving. A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended
to incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade
through the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately
tracking undisturbed and disturbed soil. Each interaction is approximated as a
flat blade moving through a locally homogeneous soil, enabling modeling of
cutting forces using the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE). Building
upon our prior work on in situ soil-property estimation, a method is devised to
extract approximate geometric parameters of the model given the uneven terrain,
and an improved physics infused neural network (PINN) model is developed to
predict soil properties and uncertainties of these estimates. A simulation of a
compact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to
train the PINN model. Post-training, the model is leveraged online by the
mapping system to track soil property estimates spatially as separate layers in
the map, with updates being performed in a Bayesian manner. Initial experiments
show that the system accurately highlights regions requiring higher relative
interaction forces, indicating the promise of this approach in enabling
soil-aware planning for autonomous terrain shaping.

### [4] [Improving Generalization Ability of Robotic Imitation Learning by Resolving Causal Confusion in Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22380)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模仿学习技术在面对训练环境与部署环境之间的微小变化时泛化能力较差，限制了性能。

Result: 在ALOHA双臂机器人模拟实验中，该方法显著缓解了现有复杂模仿学习算法的泛化问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了模仿学习在机器人操作中的泛化能力，且实现简单。

Abstract: Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic
manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from
poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain
shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of
complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the
training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by
observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly
learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert
actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural
function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.
Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to
satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we
theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal
relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning
framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning
architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our
approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,
and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem
of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.

### [5] [Safety Evaluation of Motion Plans Using Trajectory Predictors as Forward Reachable Set Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22389)
*Kaustav Chakraborty,Zeyuan Feng,Sushant Veer,Apoorva Sharma,Wenhao Ding,Sever Topan,Boris Ivanovic,Marco Pavone,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态轨迹预测的安全监控方法，通过凸优化和保形预测确保运动计划的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统缺乏可解释性，需要一种既能检测所有不安全计划（完整性）又不误判安全计划（可靠性）的安全监控方法。

Method: 利用多模态轨迹预测近似周围智能体的前向可达集（FRS），通过凸优化提取数据驱动的FRS，并结合保形预测和贝叶斯滤波器确保完整性和可靠性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了可靠性，同时保持了完整性。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习型自动驾驶系统提供了一种实用且可靠的安全监控方案。

Abstract: The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable
intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the
final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of
the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to
detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we
propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal
trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of
surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract
these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions,
conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure
completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and
guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To
preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor
failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS
conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess
the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with
these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible
future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show
our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness,
offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.

### [6] [Comparing Normalizing Flows with Kernel Density Estimation in Estimating Risk of Automated Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22429)
*Erwin de Gelder,Maren Buermann,Olaf Op den Camp*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出使用归一化流（NF）来估计自动驾驶系统（ADS）安全验证中场景参数的PDF，相较于传统方法KDE，NF在高维数据中表现更好，能更精确评估风险不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统的安全验证需要准确估计场景参数的PDF，传统方法如KDE在高维数据中受限，而NF能避免对PDF形状的强假设，提供更灵活的高维密度估计。

Method: 采用归一化流（NF）模型，通过可逆和可微映射将简单分布转换为复杂分布，用于高维PDF估计，并与KDE方法进行性能对比。

Result: NF在高维数据中表现优于KDE，能更精确地量化风险及风险不确定性，尽管计算资源需求更高。

Conclusion: NF在基于场景的安全验证中具有潜力，未来可进一步优化其架构和训练参数以提升适用性。

Abstract: The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe
deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals
of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing
with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,
where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a
quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios
must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is
expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions
about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while
avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited
parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF
of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple
base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and
differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation
without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,
comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional
method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational
resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.
As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more
precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future
work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and
optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training
hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯优化（BO）的框架，用于加速自动驾驶功能（ADFs）中关键场景的发现，显著减少了模拟次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆（AVs）的验证主要依赖模拟，但全面探索参数空间计算成本高且耗时。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化框架，应用于基于模型预测控制器（MPC）的运动规划器。

Result: 该框架能以远少于暴力实验设计（DoE）方法的模拟次数识别危险场景（如越野事件），并在高维参数空间中表现出可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架能高效发现多个不同的关键区域，为自动驾驶验证提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: Rigorous Verification and Validation (V&V) of Autonomous Driving Functions
(ADFs) is paramount for ensuring the safety and public acceptance of Autonomous
Vehicles (AVs). Current validation relies heavily on simulation to achieve
sufficient test coverage within the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of a
vehicle, but exhaustively exploring the vast parameter space of possible
scenarios is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces
a framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the discovery of
critical scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an
Model Predictive Controller (MPC)-based motion planner, showing that it
identifies hazardous situations, such as off-road events, using orders of
magnitude fewer simulations than brute-force Design of Experiments (DoE)
methods. Furthermore, this study investigates the scalability of the framework
in higher-dimensional parameter spaces and its ability to identify multiple,
distinct critical regions within the ODD of the motion planner used as the case
study .

Conclusion: 通过场景数据库和NATM的结合，为ADS的安全评估提供了实用且全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Before introducing an Automated Driving System (ADS) on the road at scale,
the manufacturer must conduct some sort of safety assurance. To structure and
harmonize the safety assurance process, the UNECE WP.29 Working Party on
Automated/Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (GRVA) is developing the New
Assessment/Test Method (NATM) that indicates what steps need to be taken for
safety assessment of an ADS. In this paper, we will show how to practically
conduct safety assessment making use of a scenario database, and what
additional steps must be taken to fully operationalize the NATM. In addition,
we will elaborate on how the use of scenario databases fits with methods
developed in the Horizon Europe projects that focus on safety assessment
following the NATM approach.

Result: 实验表明，框架减少了14%的网络参数和35%的能耗，并实现实时导航。

Conclusion: 该框架在无需GPU加速的情况下实现高效导航，并支持从仿真到现实的零样本迁移。

Abstract: Land-air bimodal robots (LABR) are gaining attention for autonomous
navigation, combining high mobility from aerial vehicles with long endurance
from ground vehicles. However, existing LABR navigation methods are limited by
suboptimal trajectories from mapping-based approaches and the excessive
computational demands of learning-based methods. To address this, we propose a
two-stage lightweight framework that integrates global key points prediction
with local trajectory refinement to generate efficient and reachable
trajectories. In the first stage, the Global Key points Prediction Network
(GKPN) was used to generate a hybrid land-air keypoint path. The GKPN includes
a Sobel Perception Network (SPN) for improved obstacle detection and a
Lightweight Attention Planning Network (LAPN) to improves predictive ability by
capturing contextual information. In the second stage, the global path is
segmented based on predicted key points and refined using a mapping-based
planner to create smooth, collision-free trajectories. Experiments conducted on
our LABR platform show that our framework reduces network parameters by 14\%
and energy consumption during land-air transitions by 35\% compared to existing
approaches. The framework achieves real-time navigation without GPU
acceleration and enables zero-shot transfer from simulation to reality during

Motivation: 传统下水道管道故障检测方法依赖人工检查CCTV录像，效率低且易出错，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 结合可解释深度学习异常检测（空间定位）与SPRT（时间证据聚合），提升噪声环境下的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该系统在异常检测性能上有所提升。

Conclusion: 结合时空分析的系统为下水道检测提供了可靠且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Sewer pipe faults, such as leaks and blockages, can lead to severe
consequences including groundwater contamination, property damage, and service
disruption. Traditional inspection methods rely heavily on the manual review of
CCTV footage collected by mobile robots, which is inefficient and susceptible
to human error. To automate this process, we propose a novel system
incorporating explainable deep learning anomaly detection combined with
sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT). The anomaly detector processes
single image frames, providing interpretable spatial localisation of anomalies,
whilst the SPRT introduces temporal evidence aggregation, enhancing robustness
against noise over sequences of image frames. Experimental results demonstrate
improved anomaly detection performance, highlighting the benefits of the
combined spatiotemporal analysis system for reliable and robust sewer
inspection.

Abstract: Developing controllers that generalize across diverse robot morphologies
remains a significant challenge in legged locomotion. Traditional approaches
either create specialized controllers for each morphology or compromise
performance for generality. This paper introduces a two-stage teacher-student
framework that bridges this gap through policy distillation. First, we train
specialized teacher policies optimized for individual morphologies, capturing
the unique optimal control strategies for each robot design. Then, we distill
this specialized expertise into a single Transformer-based student policy
capable of controlling robots with varying leg configurations. Our experiments
across five distinct legged morphologies demonstrate that our approach
preserves morphology-specific optimal behaviors, with the Transformer
architecture achieving 94.47\% of teacher performance on training morphologies
and 72.64\% on unseen robot designs. Comparative analysis reveals that
Transformer-based architectures consistently outperform MLP baselines by
leveraging attention mechanisms to effectively model joint relationships across
different kinematic structures. We validate our approach through successful
deployment on a physical quadruped robot, demonstrating the practical viability
of our morphology-agnostic control framework. This work presents a scalable
solution for developing universal legged robot controllers that maintain
near-optimal performance while generalizing across diverse morphologies.
