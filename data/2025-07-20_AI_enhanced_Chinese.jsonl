This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration.
