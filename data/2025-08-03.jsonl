These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,\nlimited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction\nfrom perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified\nPerception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion\n(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered\nreasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with\nhigh-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural\nlanguage-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable\ncontext-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving.

Accurately assessing user\nexperience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this\nadaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as\nsentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these\nindividually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging\nmultimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a\nTransformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for\nestimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our\napproach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a\nmulti-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal\ndynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX\nestimation."}

This paper presents a systematic evaluation\nof a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly\nprompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,\nand compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a\nvariety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how\nfaithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can\nactually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these\nmodels in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on\nsimpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios\nthat require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict\nconstraint compliance.

We propose a\nsubject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that\nuses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to\nestimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our\nmethod improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with\nvarying hand geometries. We introduce a data-driven approach to empirically\ntune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling more\naccurate and consistent calibration across participants. Quantitative results\nfrom seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking\nerrors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative\nvisualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in\nmotion fidelity.

A\nprimary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or\nenvironments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors\nacross diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this\nchallenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can\nachieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore\nRL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction\ncapabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL\nrepresentation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a\nunified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome\nthe significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task\nsynthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale\nmulti-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework\nto support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction\nsuccess rates by $4\\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial\nreasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings.
