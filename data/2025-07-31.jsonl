We present FLORES (reconfigured wheel-legged robot for enhanced\nsteering and adaptability), a novel wheel-legged robot design featuring a\ndistinctive front-leg configuration that sets it beyond standard design\napproaches. Specifically, FLORES replaces the conventional hip-roll degree of\nfreedom (DoF) of the front leg with hip-yaw DoFs, and this allows for efficient\nmovement on flat surfaces while ensuring adaptability when navigating complex\nterrains. This innovative design facilitates seamless transitions between\ndifferent locomotion modes (i.e., legged locomotion and wheeled locomotion) and\noptimizes the performance across varied environments. To fully exploit FLORES's\nmechanical capabilities, we develop a tailored reinforcement learning (RL)\ncontroller that adapts the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) with a customized reward\nstructure optimized for our unique mechanical configuration. This framework\nenables the generation of adaptive, multi-modal locomotion strategies that\nfacilitate smooth transitions between wheeled and legged movements.\nFurthermore, our distinctive joint design enables the robot to exhibit novel\nand highly efficient locomotion gaits that capitalize on the synergistic\nadvantages of both locomotion modes.

In this chapter, a a\nsoil-property mapping system is proposed to extend the environmental state, in\norder to overcome these restrictions and facilitate development of more robust\nautonomous earthmoving. A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended\nto incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade\nthrough the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately\ntracking undisturbed and disturbed soil. Each interaction is approximated as a\nflat blade moving through a locally homogeneous soil, enabling modeling of\ncutting forces using the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE). Building\nupon our prior work on in situ soil-property estimation, a method is devised to\nextract approximate geometric parameters of the model given the uneven terrain,\nand an improved physics infused neural network (PINN) model is developed to\npredict soil properties and uncertainties of these estimates. A simulation of a\ncompact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to\ntrain the PINN model. Post-training, the model is leveraged online by the\nmapping system to track soil property estimates spatially as separate layers in\nthe map, with updates being performed in a Bayesian manner. Initial experiments\nshow that the system accurately highlights regions requiring higher relative\ninteraction forces, indicating the promise of this approach in enabling\nsoil-aware planning for autonomous terrain shaping."}

However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from\npoor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain\nshifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of\ncomplex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the\ntraining environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by\nobservations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly\nlearn the causal relationship between observation components and expert\nactions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural\nfunction is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.\nDisentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to\nsatisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we\ntheoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal\nrelationship learning.

One of the goals\nof safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing\nwith real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,\nwhere test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a\nquantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios\nmust be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is\nexpressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions\nabout the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while\navoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited\nparameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF\nof the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple\nbase distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and\ndifferentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation\nwithout restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,\ncomparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional\nmethod for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational\nresources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.\nAs a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more\nprecise assessment of an ADS's safety.\n  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future\nwork involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and\noptimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training\nhyperparameters to further enhance their applicability."}
