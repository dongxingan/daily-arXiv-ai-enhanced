In contrast, insect-scale aerial\nrobots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body\nacceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot\ninertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high\nsusceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers\nrequires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the\nhardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and\nenvironmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube\nmodel predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and\nrobustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive\ncontroller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To\nachieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we\ndesign imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural\nnetwork, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of\ncentral nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like\nsaccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per\nsecond and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\\%$ and 255$\\%$\nimprovement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers\nunder 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force\nmapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11\nseconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results\nrepresent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire\nfuture investigations on sensing and compute autonomy."}

To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale\ndataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71\nindoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying\nlevels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their\npreservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future\nresearch. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline\nthat efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations.
