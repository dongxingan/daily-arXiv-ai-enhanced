While primarily\nfocusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling\nsurface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using\npoint cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,\nwhich are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By\nutilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need\nextensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by\naggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework\niteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using\ndifferentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.\nBy quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to\nmaximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures.

This work provides a comparative\nevaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied\nto weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite\nimagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights\nreflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel\nImproved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe\nsatellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra,\nRRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset,\nwhich provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed\nunder identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost,\ncomputation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra\nconsistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D\nscenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial\nroad-maps.

Its\nsuccess remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided\nvisualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further\ncomplicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle\nplacement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems\noffer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In\nthis work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline,\nfrom scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a\ndeep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a\ndepth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously\ndefine the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework\nis proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and\narteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone.\nFinally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance\nwith operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity\ncommercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The\nproposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the\nfirst attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15\n\\textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less\nthan or close to 1 \\textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first\nrobotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated\nplanning, scanning, and insertion. Experimental results show its potential for\nclinical translation."}
