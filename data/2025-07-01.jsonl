This paper presents APS-Net, a novel approach to\ngarment manipulation that combines unfolding and standardization in a unified\nframework. APS-Net employs a dual-arm, multi-primitive policy with dynamic\nfling to quickly unfold crumpled garments and pick-and-place (p and p) for\nprecise alignment.

Inspired by how infants and athletes rely on external support--such\nas parental walkers or coach-applied guidance--to acquire skills like walking,\ndancing, and performing acrobatic flips, we propose A2CF: Adaptive Assistive\nCurriculum Force for humanoid motion learning. A2CF trains a dual-agent system,\nin which a dedicated assistive force agent applies state-dependent forces to\nguide the robot through difficult initial motions and gradually reduces\nassistance as the robot's proficiency improves. Across three\nbenchmarks--bipedal walking, choreographed dancing, and backflip--A2CF achieves\nconvergence 30% faster than baseline methods, lowers failure rates by over 40%,\nand ultimately produces robust, support-free policies. Real-world experiments\nfurther demonstrate that adaptively applied assistive forces significantly\naccelerate the acquisition of complex skills in high-dimensional robotic\ncontrol."}

As\na result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective\nescorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement\ndynamics.

For robots to perform actions\nreliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,\nweight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical\nconstraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being\nclosed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue\nthat off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded\nunderstanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.\n  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of\ncore Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability\nperspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,\ncomprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1\nto 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,\nand 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.\n  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to\ngrasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their\nsuitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for\ntargeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for\nrigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of\nmore robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.\n  Project Page: https://pacbench.github.io/"}

This paper presents a test environment that combines a\nVehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and\nvehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian\nlocalization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach\nthrough a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations\nof VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a\ncommercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is\ngenerated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and\nprojected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation\ntechnique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle\nperception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP\ndomains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in\nmovement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes\ndynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are\nmonitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in\nHPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable\ninaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for\ncomplex cyclist postures. These findings contribute to refining CP testing\napproaches for evaluating next-generation AI-based vehicle perception and to\nenhancing interaction models of automated vehicles and VRUs in CP environments."}

However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy\nstructure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle\ncontrol commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in\nnetwork outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals\ncannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore,\nwe propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our\napproach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL\npolicies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and\nshort-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is\nexplicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving\nbehaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state\nupdates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure\nmulti-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based\nhighway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly\nimproves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action\nconsistency and safety."}

To\novercome these limitations, we propose a 3D inspection approach that unifies\nperception, planning, and control within a single data-driven predictive\ncontrol framework.

While\nproprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle\navoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising\ndegradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the\nunderlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions\nof proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that\nbridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using\nWasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout\nproprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of\nstates, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances\nrobustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and\ndeployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage\nproprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms\nthe naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed\nto address distributional shifts."}
