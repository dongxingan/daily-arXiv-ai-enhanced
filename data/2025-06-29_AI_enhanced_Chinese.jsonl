This is\naccentuated when the object mass to robot payload ratio increases, given the\nstrong inertial components characterizing this task. This paper aims to address\nthis problem by proposing an implicitly impact-aware framework that\naccomplishes the catching task in both pre- and post-catching phases. In the\nfirst phase, a motion planner generates optimal trajectories that minimize\ncatching forces, while in the second, the object's energy is dissipated\nsmoothly, minimizing bouncing. In particular, in the pre-catching phase, a\nreal-time optimal planner is responsible for generating trajectories of the\nend-effector that minimize the velocity difference between the robot and the\nobject to reduce impact forces during catching. In the post-catching phase, the\nrobot's position, velocity, and stiffness trajectories are generated based on\nhuman demonstrations when catching a series of free-falling objects with\nunknown masses. A hierarchical quadratic programming-based controller is used\nto enforce the robot's constraints (i.e., joint and torque limits) and create a\nstack of tasks that minimizes the reflected mass at the end-effector as a\nsecondary objective. The initial experiments isolate the problem along one\ndimension to accurately study the effects of each contribution on the metrics\nproposed. We show how the same task, without velocity matching, would be\ninfeasible due to excessive joint torques resulting from the impact. The\naddition of reflected mass minimization is then investigated, and the catching\nheight is increased to evaluate the method's robustness.
