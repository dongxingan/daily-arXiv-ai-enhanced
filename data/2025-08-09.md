### [1] [On the causality between affective impact and coordinated human-robot reactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04834)
*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究机器人是否通过主动与人类共享事件反应来改变人类对其情感影响的感知，发现共享反应和特定延迟时间显著影响感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善机器人在社交环境中的表现，探究其情感表达对人类感知的影响。

Method: 设计两个实验：1）隔离机器人情感表达的反应元素；2）测试不同反应延迟时间对物理互动的影响。

Result: 共享事件的机器人反应显著改变人类感知（p<0.05）；物理互动中，接近人类的反应时间（200ms）效果最佳。

Conclusion: 200ms延迟对小型非人形机器人最有效；100ms延迟则让人类感觉对机器人影响最大。

Abstract: In an effort to improve how robots function in social contexts, this paper
investigates if a robot that actively shares a reaction to an event with a
human alters how the human perceives the robot's affective impact. To verify
this, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the
reaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the
effects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical
encounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups
(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting
with the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using
increasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.
The results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived
affective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human
observer rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared
physical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most
appropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around
200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized
non-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time
around 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers
feel they made the biggest impact on the robot.

### [2] [INTENTION: Inferring Tendencies of Humanoid Robot Motion Through Interactive Intuition and Grounded VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04931)
*Jin Wang,Weijie Wang,Boyuan Deng,Heng Zhang,Rui Dai,Nikos Tsagarakis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出INTENTION框架，结合视觉语言模型和交互驱动记忆，赋予机器人直觉式交互能力，实现自主操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人控制依赖精确模型和预定义动作，难以适应复杂现实场景，而人类通过直觉和物理理解表现出强大适应性。

Method: 提出Memory Graph记录任务交互场景，设计Intuitive Perceptor提取物理关系和功能属性，结合视觉语言模型进行推理。

Result: 机器人能在新场景中推断合适交互行为，无需重复指令。

Conclusion: INTENTION框架提升了机器人在多样化场景中的自主操作能力。

Abstract: Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on
precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in
structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due
to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In
contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating
remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical
understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling
robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in
diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene
reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record
scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding
and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design
an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from
visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate
interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions.

### [3] [Optimal Planning for Multi-Robot Simultaneous Area and Line Coverage Using Hierarchical Cyclic Merging Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04981)
*Tianyuan Zheng,Jingang Yi,Kaiyan Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于分层循环合并调节（HCMR）的算法，用于解决多机器人同时覆盖线性特征和区域的优化路径规划问题，显著提升了效率和避免冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多机器人在已知环境中高效、无冲突地完成线性特征覆盖和区域探索的双重任务，以降低操作成本并提高效率。

Method: 采用分层循环合并调节（HCMR）算法，结合Morse理论分析图遍历中的流形附着过程，并通过边序列反向传播和平衡分区生成最优路径。

Result: HCMR算法在模拟中显著优于现有方法，路径长度减少至少10.0%，任务时间平均降低16.9%，且确保无冲突操作。

Conclusion: HCMR算法在固定扫描方向下被证明是最优的，为多机器人双重覆盖问题提供了高效且无冲突的解决方案。

Abstract: The double coverage problem focuses on determining efficient, collision-free
routes for multiple robots to simultaneously cover linear features (e.g.,
surface cracks or road routes) and survey areas (e.g., parking lots or local
regions) in known environments. In these problems, each robot carries two
functional roles: service (linear feature footprint coverage) and exploration
(complete area coverage). Service has a smaller operational footprint but
incurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal
planning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic
merging regulation (HCMR). To reduce the complexity for optimal planning
solutions, we analyze the manifold attachment process during graph traversal
from a Morse theory perspective. We show that solutions satisfying minimum path
length and collision-free constraints must belong to a Morse-bounded
collection. To identify this collection, we introduce the HCMR algorithm. In
HCMR, cyclic merging search regulates traversal behavior, while edge sequence
back propagation converts these regulations into graph edge traversal
sequences. Incorporating balanced partitioning, the optimal sequence is
selected to generate routes for each robot. We prove the optimality of the HCMR
algorithm under a fixed sweep direction. The multi-robot simulation results
demonstrate that the HCMR algorithm significantly improves planned path length
by at least 10.0%, reduces task time by at least 16.9% in average, and ensures
conflict-free operation compared to other state-of-the-art planning methods.

### [4] [Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Autonomous Maze Navigation of Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04994)
*Wenjie Hu,Ye Zhou,Hann Woei Ho*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的层次化DDPG（HDDPG）算法，通过高、低层策略结合，解决了标准DDPG在迷宫导航中的稀疏奖励和探索效率低等问题，显著提升了成功率和平均奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DDPG算法在迷宫导航任务中表现不佳，主要由于稀疏奖励、探索效率低和长时规划困难，导致成功率低和奖励不足。

Method: 提出HDDPG算法，包含高层策略（生成子目标）和低层策略（生成动作），结合离策略校正、自适应参数噪声和重塑奖励函数，优化探索和学习效率。

Result: 在ROS和Gazebo仿真实验中，HDDPG相比基线算法，成功率提升至少56.59%，平均奖励增加至少519.03。

Conclusion: HDDPG有效解决了标准DDPG的局限性，显著提升了迷宫导航任务的性能。

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to
traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze
navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and
long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and
average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG
(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The
high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate
subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The
low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates
primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal
assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with
off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical
experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to
improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is
employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including
gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve
robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical
simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and
Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze
navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard
DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and
boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline
algorithms.

### [5] [A General Control Method for Human-Robot Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14762)
*Maddalena Feder,Giorgio Grioli,Manuel G. Catalano,Antonio Bicchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的广义控制方法，用于多自由度设备，帮助运动能力有限的人群完成日常活动。该方法通过将用户的低维运动映射到复杂机器人辅助设备（如假肢、超级肢体或远程机器人替身）中，实现人与机器人的无缝集成，减少用户的不适和努力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为运动能力受限的人群提供一种高效的控制方法，使其能够通过简单的动作控制复杂的机器人辅助设备，从而提升生活质量。

Method: 提出了一种框架，将用户执行的补偿性动作转化为机器人命令，以实现目标并减少补偿。该方法适用于从假肢到全身机器人替身的各种多自由度设备。

Result: 通过模拟场景和真实世界试验（包括虚拟双胞胎和物理人形替身）验证了该控制策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为多自由度辅助系统的控制提供了一种通用解决方案，能够显著减少用户的努力和不适，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new generalized control method designed for
multi-degrees-of-freedom devices to help people with limited motion
capabilities in their daily activities. The challenge lies in finding the most
adapted strategy for the control interface to effectively map user's motions in
a low-dimensional space to complex robotic assistive devices, such as
prostheses, supernumerary limbs, up to remote robotic avatars. The goal is a
system which integrates the human and the robotic parts into a unique system,
moving so as to reach the targets decided by the human while autonomously
reducing the user's effort and discomfort. We present a framework to control
general multi DoFs assistive systems, which translates user-performed
compensatory motions into the necessary robot commands for reaching targets
while canceling or reducing compensation. The framework extends to prostheses
of any number of DoF up to full robotic avatars, regarded here as a sort of
whole-body prosthesis of the person who sees the robot as an artificial
extension of their own body without a physical link but with a sensory-motor
integration. We have validated and applied this control strategy through tests
encompassing simulated scenarios and real-world trials involving a virtual twin
of the robotic parts (prosthesis and robot) and a physical humanoid avatar.

### [6] [MAG-Nav: Language-Driven Object Navigation Leveraging Memory-Reserved Active Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05021)
*Weifan Zhang,Tingguang Li,Yuzhen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的导航框架，通过主动视角调整和历史记忆回溯机制，显著提升了复杂未知环境中的视觉语言定位能力，并在零样本条件下实现了强泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能机器人在未知环境中仅依赖自然语言描述进行视觉导航的挑战。

Result: 在HM3D数据集上优于现有方法，并在四足机器人上验证了实际导航性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过主动感知和记忆机制，显著提升了语言驱动导航的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Visual navigation in unknown environments based solely on natural language
descriptions is a key capability for intelligent robots. In this work, we
propose a navigation framework built upon off-the-shelf Visual Language Models
(VLMs), enhanced with two human-inspired mechanisms: perspective-based active
grounding, which dynamically adjusts the robot's viewpoint for improved visual
inspection, and historical memory backtracking, which enables the system to
retain and re-evaluate uncertain observations over time. Unlike existing
approaches that passively rely on incidental visual inputs, our method actively
optimizes perception and leverages memory to resolve ambiguity, significantly
improving vision-language grounding in complex, unseen environments. Our
framework operates in a zero-shot manner, achieving strong generalization to
diverse and open-ended language descriptions without requiring labeled data or
model fine-tuning. Experimental results on Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in language-driven
object navigation. We further demonstrate its practicality through real-world
deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving robust and effective navigation
performance.

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 推导了一种视觉测量模型，直接关联地标表示与多相机姿态和观测，形成紧密耦合的姿态-地标关系，并保持完美的零空间。

Result: 仿真和真实实验表明，该方法在效率和精度上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了GVIO的计算效率和精度，适用于多传感器融合场景。

Abstract: Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in
vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational
burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its
efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view
pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial
Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual
measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with
multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven
to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null
space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed
approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both
simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

Result: 研究提供了不同模拟场景下的性能比较，并展示了组合策略的优势。

Conclusion: 提出的组合策略在多机械臂运动规划中实现了性能与运行时间的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Generating high-quality motion plans for multiple robot arms is challenging
due to the high dimensionality of the system and the potential for inter-arm
collisions. Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions that are
suboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution time for multi-arm systems.
Post-processing via shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality
for efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm scenarios, optimizing
one arm's motion must not introduce collisions with other arms. Although
existing multi-arm planning works often use some form of shortcutting
techniques, their exact methodology and impact on performance are often vaguely
described. In this work, we present a comprehensive study quantitatively
comparing existing shortcutting methods for multi-arm trajectories across
diverse simulated scenarios. We carefully analyze the pros and cons of each
shortcutting method and propose two simple strategies for combining these
methods to achieve the best performance-runtime tradeoff. Video, code, and
dataset are available at https://philip-huang.github.io/mr-shortcut/.

Result: 在分布内场景中，成功率提高8.80%，碰撞减少3.72倍，侵入轨迹减少2.43倍；在分布外场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实机器人上验证有效，能够安全地与稀疏和密集人群交互。

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are
available on https://gen-safe-nav.github.io/.

Result: 实验验证了系统能即时响应碰撞，并能精确检测碰撞方向和大小。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效提升软夹持器在动态抓取中的稳定性和安全性。

Abstract: External collisions to robot actuators typically pose risks to grasping
circular objects. This work presents a vision-based sensing module capable of
detecting collisions to maintain stable grasping with a soft gripper system.
The system employs an eye-in-palm camera with a broad field of view to
simultaneously monitor the motion of fingers and the grasped object.
Furthermore, we have developed a collision-rich grasping strategy to ensure the
stability and security of the entire dynamic grasping process. A physical soft
gripper was manufactured and affixed to a collaborative robotic arm to evaluate
the performance of the collision detection mechanism. An experiment regarding
testing the response time of the mechanism confirmed the system has the
capability to react to the collision instantaneously. A dodging test was
conducted to demonstrate the gripper can detect the direction and scale of
external collisions precisely.

Motivation: 提升人机交互中机器人动作的可读性，使人类能更准确地预测机器人意图。

Method: 使用NICO人形机器人进行实验，观察参与者对不同线索（如目光、指向动作）的反应，手臂轨迹被截断至60%或80%。

Result: 实验支持多模态优越性和视觉主导假设。

Conclusion: 机器人的目光和指向动作结合能显著提高人类对其意图的预测准确性。

Abstract: Human--robot interaction requires robots whose actions are legible, allowing
humans to interpret, predict, and feel safe around them. This study
investigates the legibility of humanoid robot arm movements in a pointing task,
aiming to understand how humans predict robot intentions from truncated
movements and bodily cues. We designed an experiment using the NICO humanoid
robot, where participants observed its arm movements towards targets on a
touchscreen. Robot cues varied across conditions: gaze, pointing, and pointing
with congruent or incongruent gaze. Arm trajectories were stopped at 60\% or
80\% of their full length, and participants predicted the final target. We
tested the multimodal superiority and ocular primacy hypotheses, both of which
were supported by the experiment.

that of locally operated robots. We have designed a specific protocol
consisting of multiple questionnaires, along with a dedicated software
architecture using the Robotics Operating System (ROS) and Unity. The results
revealed no statistically significant differences between the local and remote
robot conditions, suggesting that robots may be a viable alternative to
traditional local control.

TL;DR: Chemist Eye是一个分布式安全监控系统，用于提升自动驾驶实验室（SDL）的安全性，通过视觉-语言模型（VLM）实时监控危险并指导机器人行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶实验室中，机器人使用易燃锂电池增加了火灾风险，同时PPE合规性和人员安全也是关键问题。需要一种系统来增强安全意识和应急响应。

Method: 系统整合RGB、深度和红外摄像头，利用VLM进行决策，实时监控危险并指导机器人远离危险区域，同时通过第三方平台通知人员。

Result: 在真实SDL环境中测试，Chemist Eye对安全危险的识别和决策性能分别达到97%和95%。

Conclusion: Chemist Eye有效提升了SDL的安全性，为实验室自动化提供了可靠的安全监控解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories
(SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that
already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective
equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and
well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are
another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that
occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have
increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety
monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system
integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,
designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot
workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE
compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making
driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless
integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM
recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential
fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible
warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging
platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist
Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and
found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making
performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人衣物操作中因高维性、复杂动态和类别内差异导致的泛化难题。

Method: 提出FCBV-Net，基于3D点云，利用冻结的几何特征预测双手动作价值，下游可训练组件学习任务策略。

Result: 在模拟实验中，FCBV-Net对未见衣物的效率下降仅11.5%，优于2D图像基线（96.2%），最终覆盖率达89%，优于3D基线（83%）。

Conclusion: 几何理解与双手动作价值学习的解耦能实现更好的类别级泛化。

Abstract: Category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation, such as
bimanual smoothing, remains a significant hurdle due to high dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and intra-category variations. Current approaches often
struggle, either overfitting with concurrently learned visual features for a
specific instance or, despite category-level perceptual generalization, failing
to predict the value of synergistic bimanual actions. We propose the
Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net), operating on 3D point
clouds to specifically enhance category-level policy generalization for garment
smoothing. FCBV-Net conditions bimanual action value prediction on pre-trained,
frozen dense geometric features, ensuring robustness to intra-category garment
variations. Trainable downstream components then learn a task-specific policy
using these static features. In simulated GarmentLab experiments with the
CLOTH3D dataset, FCBV-Net demonstrated superior category-level generalization.
It exhibited only an 11.5% efficiency drop (Steps80) on unseen garments
compared to 96.2% for a 2D image-based baseline, and achieved 89% final
coverage, outperforming an 83% coverage from a 3D correspondence-based baseline
that uses identical per-point geometric features but a fixed primitive. These
results highlight that the decoupling of geometric understanding from bimanual
action value learning enables better category-level generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态视角和共享视觉编码器限制了3D感知并导致任务干扰，影响了机器人操作的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出任务感知视角规划（TAVP），结合主动视角规划和任务特定表示学习，使用伪环境加速探索策略，并引入专家混合视觉编码器。

Result: 在RLBench任务上，TAVP显著优于固定视角方法，展示了更强的动作预测能力。

Conclusion: TAVP通过任务感知的视觉表示学习，显著提升了机器人操作的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world
in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual
representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across
a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks
show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided

Conclusion: 需优化人机交互系统，考虑观众能力与期望，以创造更有意义的艺术体验。

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of 18 children's in-the-wild experiences
with the autonomous robot arm performer NED (Never-Ending Dancer) within the
Thingamabobas installation, showcased across the UK. We detail NED's design,
including costume, behaviour, and human interactions, all integral to the
installation. Our observational analysis revealed three key challenges in
child-robot interactions: 1) Initiating and maintaining engagement, 2) Lack of
robot expressivity and reciprocity, and 3) Unmet expectations. Our findings
show that children are naturally curious, and adept at interacting with a
robotic art performer. However, our observations emphasise the critical need to
optimise human-robot interaction (HRI) systems through careful consideration of
audience's capabilities, perceptions, and expectations, within the performative
arts context, to enable engaging and meaningful experiences, especially for
young audiences.

Result: 展示了基础模型在机器人领域的多样化应用，包括任务规划、API调用和诊断辅助等。

Conclusion: 基础模型和代理架构正在快速推动机器人技术的发展，未来需要进一步标准化和优化模型集成方法。

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and
human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or
large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of
robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards
agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring
GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents
are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such
agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language
instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and
diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving
nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS
packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a
taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative
analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's
literature.

TL;DR: GhostShell利用大型语言模型（LLMs）实现流式并发行为编程，通过动态函数调用和调度器协调机器人动作，显著提升响应速度和任务正确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义动作序列或行为树，限制了机器人系统的灵活性和实时性。GhostShell旨在通过LLM的流式输出实现动态行为编程。

Method: GhostShell包含流式XML函数标记解析器、动态函数接口映射器和多通道调度器，支持同步和异步函数调用，协调多机器人组件动作。

Result: 在34个真实世界交互任务中，GhostShell的行为正确率指标达到0.85，响应速度比原生LLM API快66倍，并在长时多模态任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: GhostShell为机器人系统提供了一种高效、灵活的行为编程方法，显著提升了实时性和任务完成能力。

Abstract: We present GhostShell, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enable streaming and concurrent behavioral programming for embodied
systems. In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action
sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act
on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from
the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic
function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates
intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls,
thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic
components as directed by the LLM. We evaluate GhostShell on our robot
prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world
interaction tasks and multiple LLMs. The results demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4
Sonnet and up to 66X faster response times compared to LLM native function
calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal
tasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

Motivation: 解决传统低级别轨迹模仿在跨对象类型、空间布局和操纵器配置时泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提取基于香农信息的任务相关手和物体线索，编码为时序场景图，结合语言条件变换器生成行为树和运动指令，并引入跨手选择策略。

Conclusion: GF-VLA在多样空间和语义变化中表现出强泛化能力和鲁棒性，为机器人学习提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to
the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize
across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We
propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables
dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly
from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts
Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest
task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs
that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are
fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve
execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand
selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit
geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block
assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial
generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene
representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask
segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and
human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these
policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90
percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric
reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness
across diverse spatial and semantic variations.

TL;DR: Affecta-context框架通过物理上下文信息指导社交机器人行为适应，包括上下文表示和行为优先级学习，通过实验验证其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为社交机器人提供一种基于物理上下文的行为适应框架，以优化其在不同环境和用户偏好下的行为表现。

Method: 框架分为两部分：上下文表示和行为优先级学习，通过聚类物理属性和交互学习实现行为优化。

Result: 在72次交互实验中，机器人成功学习行为优先级，并能泛化到未访问的物理上下文。

Conclusion: Affecta-context框架有效支持社交机器人在不同环境中的行为适应和优化。

Abstract: This paper presents Affecta-context, a general framework to facilitate
behavior adaptation for social robots. The framework uses information about the
physical context to guide its behaviors in human-robot interactions. It
consists of two parts: one that represents encountered contexts and one that
learns to prioritize between behaviors through human-robot interactions. As
physical contexts are encountered the framework clusters them by their measured
physical properties. In each context, the framework learns to prioritize
between behaviors to optimize the physical attributes of the robot's behavior
in line with its current environment and the preferences of the users it
interacts with. This paper illlustrates the abilities of the Affecta-context
framework by enabling a robot to autonomously learn the prioritization of
discrete behaviors. This was achieved by training across 72 interactions in two
different physical contexts with 6 different human test participants. The paper
demonstrates the trained Affecta-context framework by verifying the robot's
ability to generalize over the input and to match its behaviors to a previously
unvisited physical context.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在人与机器人高强度对抗场景中，通过五种情感表达方式缓解冲突的效果，发现所有方式均有效，但运动方式略有不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解机器人如何通过情感表达缓解人类对低性能机器人的敌意。

Method: 使用定制情感机器人在模拟冲突场景中测试105名参与者，评估五种表达方式的效果。

Result: 所有表达方式均能成功缓解冲突，运动方式与其他方式略有差异，参与者对各方式的感知相似。

Conclusion: 缓解高强度互动可能更需关注机器人的社会情境感知能力，而非特定表达方式。

Abstract: This paper investigates the specific scenario of high-intensity
confrontations between humans and robots, to understand how robots can defuse
the conflict. It focuses on the effectiveness of using five different affective
expression modalities as main drivers for defusing the conflict. The aim is to
discover any strengths or weaknesses in using each modality to mitigate the
hostility that people feel towards a poorly performing robot. The defusing of
the situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the
conflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a
custom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test
participants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can
successfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of
the confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement
modality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test
participants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the
robot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities. This indicates
that defusing a high-intensity interaction may not demand special attention to
the expression abilities of the robot, but rather require attention to the
abilities of being socially aware of the situation and reacting in accordance
with it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在机器人操作任务中表现优异，但其推理时间过长且需要执行动作块以保持一致性，限制了其在延迟敏感任务中的应用。

Method: 采用实时迭代（RTI）方案，利用前一时间步的解作为初始猜测，并提出了处理离散动作的缩放方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著降低了推理时间，同时保持了与全步去噪扩散策略相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源密集型大型模型的扩散策略提供了高效推理方案，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic
manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an
extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk
before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their
applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle
time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy
structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,
which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a
method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging
solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent
iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference
and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such
as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces
runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy
redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained
diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We
also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful
for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive
simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with
comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step
denoising. Our project page with additional resources is available at:

Conclusion: DistillDrive通过知识蒸馏和多样化实例模仿，显著提升了自动驾驶决策的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and
model are publicly available at https://github.com/YuruiAI/DistillDrive

Abstract: Natural organisms use distributed actuation via their musculoskeletal systems
to adapt their gait for traversing diverse terrains or to morph their bodies to
perform varied tasks. A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to
mimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to
develop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,
such systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the
ability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky
control systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for
designing and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing
distributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines
3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight
actuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We
developed LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby
achieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,
which in turn results in global deformation of the robot. Furthermore, to
capitalize on the extensive design space, we develop two computational tools:
one to optimize the robot's skeletal graph, enabling multiple target
deformations, and another to co-optimize the skeletal designs and control gaits
to achieve target locomotion. We validate our system by building several robots
that show complex shape morphing, varying control schemes, and adaptability to
their environment. Our system integrates advances in modular material building,
untethered and distributed control, and computational design to introduce a new
generation of robots that brings us closer to the capabilities of living
organisms.

Motivation: 研究人类手部的生物力学特性、传感器和控制机制是否应作为机器人手的理想目标，以及是否需要拟人化的机器人手。

Method: 通过综述人类手部特性、比较商用机器人手和假肢手，并系统回顾其机制和技能，分析机器人手的设计需求。

Result: 研究发现，手腕灵活性和手指外展/内收对操作能力更重要，而增加手指数量或自由度并非必需。非拟人化设计可能优于人类手部。

Conclusion: 人类手部并非机器人手的唯一理想模型，简化设计（如三指）或非拟人化设计（如两对对立手指）可能更高效。

Abstract: Human manipulation skills represent a pinnacle of their voluntary motor
functions, requiring the coordination of many degrees of freedom and processing
of high-dimensional sensor input to achieve such a high level of dexterity.
Thus, we set out to answer whether the human hand, with its associated
biomechanical properties, sensors, and control mechanisms, is an ideal that we
should strive for in robotics-do we really need anthropomorphic robotic hands?
  This survey can help practitioners to make the trade-off between hand
complexity and potential manipulation skills. We provide an overview of the
human hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic
hands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are
capable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement
for mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is
missing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity?
  Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for
robotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist
flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are important for manipulation
capabilities. On the contrary, increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or
degrees of freedom is often not necessary. Three fingers are a good compromise
between simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two
opposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase
dexterity, suggesting that the human hand may not be the optimum.

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中验证，MICoBot显著优于纯LLM基线和其他任务分配模型。

Conclusion: MICoBot通过动态调整协作策略和任务分配，有效提升了人机协作的效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

Conclusion: CleanUpBench为日常场景中的具体智能体提供了可扩展的测试平台。

Abstract: Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning,
but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far
from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode
capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic
and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that
systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning
tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world
applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible
benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning
scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service
robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic
arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes
manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess
generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task
completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To
support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic
strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between
low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed
for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.

The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite
measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action

intelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.
