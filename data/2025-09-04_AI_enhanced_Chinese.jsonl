However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a\ncontinuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably\nfaced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on\ntest-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on\nthe fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.\nHowever, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as\nmultiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for\ntest-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the\nfine-tuned features.
