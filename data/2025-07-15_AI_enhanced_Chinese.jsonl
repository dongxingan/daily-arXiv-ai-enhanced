However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when\ndealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel\ncomputing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently\nsolve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this\npaper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the\nConsensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which\ndecomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in\nparallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per\niteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that\nintegrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the\noptimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality\nconstraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness.\nEspecially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving\nover a tenfold speedup.
