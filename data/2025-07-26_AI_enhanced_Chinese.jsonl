While substantial progress has been made\nin robotic dressing assistance, prior works typically assume that garments are\nalready unfolded and ready for use. However, in medical applications gowns and\naprons are often stored in a folded configuration, requiring an additional\nunfolding step. In this paper, we introduce the pre-dressing step, the process\nof unfolding garments prior to assisted dressing. We leverage imitation\nlearning for learning three manipulation primitives, including both high and\nlow acceleration motions. In addition, we employ a visual classifier to\ncategorise the garment state as closed, partly opened, and fully opened. We\nconduct an empirical evaluation of the learned manipulation primitives as well\nas their combinations. Our results show that highly dynamic motions are not\neffective for unfolding freshly unpacked garments, where the combination of\nmotions can efficiently enhance the opening configuration.", "AI": {"tldr": "论文提出了机器人辅助穿衣前的展开衣物步骤，结合模仿学习和视觉分类器，验证了动态动作组合的有效性。", "motivation": "医疗环境中衣物通常折叠存放，现有研究假设衣物已展开，因此需要解决衣物展开问题以提高机器人辅助穿衣效率。", "method": "利用模仿学习学习三种操作动作（包括高低加速度动作），并使用视觉分类器识别衣物状态（闭合、部分展开、完全展开）。", "result": "动态动作组合能有效提升展开效果，但高动态动作对刚拆封衣物效果不佳。", "conclusion": "结合多种动作的组合策略能更高效地完成衣物展开，为机器人辅助穿衣提供新思路。"}}

At the same time, autonomous\nrobotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular\ntools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including\nmeasurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context,\nthis paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into\nhow the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design\noptimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We\npropose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement\nmatrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the\nsignal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is\nthe application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying\ntransform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the\nnumber of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution\nmaps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce\nrobot travel distance to less than $10\\%$ of a full-coverage path, while\nimproving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to\ntraditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by\na factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP)\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "该论文提出了一种利用压缩感知（CS）矩阵结构优化机器人环境数据采样轨迹的方法，结合蒙特卡洛优化和字典学习（DL），显著减少机器人路径长度并提高信号重建精度。", "motivation": "压缩感知在高效数据采集方面具有潜力，而机器人平台在环境监测中应用广泛。研究如何结合两者优化采样轨迹，以减少机器人移动距离并提高数据重建精度。", "method": "提出蒙特卡洛优化框架，生成优化的CS测量矩阵，结合字典学习（DL）提升稀疏变换效果，减少采样数量并提高重建精度。", "result": "实验表明，该方法将机器人路径长度减少至全覆盖路径的10%以下，重建精度比传统CS方法提高五倍，比现有信息路径规划（IPP）方法提高两倍。", "conclusion": "该方法为机器人环境监测提供了一种高效的数据采集方案，显著减少了资源消耗并提高了数据质量。"}}
