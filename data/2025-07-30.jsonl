Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer\ncomputational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert\nknowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even\nwith careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired\ntrade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are\nadaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the\nsafety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\nDecision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single\nparameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \\emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically\nadjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively\nmeasures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require\nexpert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both\nstructured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency\ntrade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner\noutperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating\nsafer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when\ntuned for efficiency.

In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological\nexplorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments.

The automated vehicle reacts to cyclist\ngestures via stimulated camera input, while the cyclist, riding a stationary\nbicycle, perceives and reacts to the vehicle in the VE in real time. Validation\nexperiments are conducted using a real automated shuttle bus with a\ntrack-and-follow function, performing three test maneuvers - straight-line\ndriving with stop, circular track driving, and double lane change - on a\nproving ground and in the coupled in-the-loop test environment. The performance\nis evaluated by comparing the resulting vehicle trajectories in both\nenvironments. Additionally, the introduced latencies of individual components\nin the test setup are measured. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the\napproach and highlight its strengths and limitations for realistic ADS\nevaluation."}

This challenge\nis exacerbated in complex, cluttered agricultural environments of high-value\ncrops, such as flowers, fruits, and vegetables, that could greatly benefit from\nrobotic systems tailored to their specific requirements. However, the design of\nsuch systems remains a challenging, intuition-driven process, limiting the\naffordability and adoption of robotics-based automation by domain experts like\nfarmers. To address this challenge, we propose a four-part design optimization\nmethodology for automating the development of task-specific robotic systems.\nThis framework includes (a) a robot design model, (b) task and environment\nrepresentations for simulation, (c) task-specific performance metrics, and (d)\noptimization algorithms for refining configurations. We demonstrate our\nframework by optimizing a dual-arm robotic system for pepper harvesting using\ntwo off-the-shelf redundant manipulators. To enhance performance, we introduce\nnovel task metrics that leverage self-motion manifolds to characterize\nmanipulator redundancy comprehensively. Our results show that our framework\nachieves simultaneous improvements in reachability success rates and\nimprovements in dexterity. Specifically, our approach improves reachability\nsuccess by at least 14\\% over baseline methods and achieves over 30\\%\nimprovement in dexterity based on our task-specific metric."}

The multiplicity of\ninverse kinematics (IK) solutions allows for the simultaneous solving of\nauxiliary tasks like avoiding joint limits or obstacles. However, the most\nwidely used IK solvers are numerical gradient-based iterative methods that\ninherently return a locally optimal solution. In this work, we explore the\ncomputation of self-motion manifolds (SMMs), which represent the set of all\njoint configurations that solve the inverse kinematics problem for redundant\nmanipulators. Thus, SMMs are global IK solutions for redundant manipulators. We\nfocus on task redundancies of dimensionality 1, introducing a novel ODE\nformulation for computing SMMs using standard explicit fixed-step ODE\nintegrators. We also address the challenge of ``inducing'' redundancy in\notherwise non-redundant manipulators assigned to tasks naturally described by\none degree of freedom less than the non-redundant manipulator. Furthermore,\nrecognizing that SMMs can consist of multiple disconnected components, we\npropose methods for searching for these separate SMM components. Our\nformulations and algorithms compute accurate SMM solutions without requiring\nadditional IK refinement, and we extend our methods to prismatic joint systems\n-- an area not covered in current SMM literature. This manuscript presents the\nderivation of these methods and several examples that show how the methods work\nand their limitations."}

However, the small size and fragility of retinal veins, coupled\nwith the need for high-precision, tremor-free needle manipulation, create\nsignificant technical challenges. These limitations highlight the need for\nrobotic assistance to improve accuracy and stability. This study presents an\nautomated robotic system with a top-down microscope and B-scan optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT) imaging for precise depth sensing. Deep\nlearning-based models enable real-time needle navigation, contact detection,\nand vein puncture recognition, using a chicken embryo model as a surrogate for\nhuman retinal veins. The system autonomously detects needle position and\npuncture events with 85% accuracy. The experiments demonstrate notable\nreductions in navigation and puncture times compared to manual methods. Our\nresults demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced imaging and deep\nlearning to automate microsurgical tasks, providing a pathway for safer and\nmore reliable RVC procedures with enhanced precision and reproducibility."}

However, loco-manipulation tasks performed by legged robots\nintroduce additional complexity, necessitating computationally efficient MPC\nalgorithms capable of handling high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) models. This letter\npresents a computationally efficient nonlinear MPC (NMPC) framework tailored\nfor loco-manipulation tasks of quadrupedal robots equipped with robotic\nmanipulators whose dynamics are non-negligible relative to those of the\nquadruped. The proposed framework adopts a decomposition strategy that couples\nlocomotion template models -- such as the single rigid body (SRB) model -- with\na full-order dynamic model of the robotic manipulator for torque-level control.\nThis decomposition enables efficient real-time solution of the NMPC problem in\na receding horizon fashion at 60 Hz. The optimal state and input trajectories\ngenerated by the NMPC for locomotion are tracked by a low-level nonlinear\nwhole-body controller (WBC) running at 500 Hz, while the optimal torque\ncommands for the manipulator are directly applied. The layered control\narchitecture is validated through extensive numerical simulations and hardware\nexperiments on a 15-kg Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot augmented with a 4.4-kg\n4-DoF Kinova arm. Given that the Kinova arm dynamics are non-negligible\nrelative to the Go2 base, the proposed NMPC framework demonstrates robust\nstability in performing diverse loco-manipulation tasks, effectively handling\nexternal disturbances, payload variations, and uneven terrain."}
