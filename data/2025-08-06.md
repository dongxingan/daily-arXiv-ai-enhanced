### [1] [Tunable Leg Stiffness in a Monopedal Hopper for Energy-Efficient Vertical Hopping Across Varying Ground Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02873)
*Rongqian Chen,Jun Kwon,Kefan Wu,Wei-Hsi Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HASTA是一种具有实时可调腿部刚度的垂直跳跃机器人，旨在优化不同地面条件下的能量效率。通过调整刚度，机器人能在各种地面条件下实现最大跳跃高度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是通过调整腿部刚度，优化机器人在不同地面条件下的能量效率，以实现最大跳跃高度。

Method: 通过实验测试和模拟，确定最佳腿部刚度组合，以适应不同地面刚度和阻尼条件。

Result: 实验结果表明，可调刚度能显著提高机器人在控制实验条件下的能量效率。

Conclusion: 可调刚度有助于能量高效的运动，并为未来开发腿部刚度选择控制器提供了见解。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable
Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time
tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various
ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By
adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric
for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform
better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while
stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and
energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the
best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground
stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state
hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our
hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in
controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides
insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting
leg stiffness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 通过设计深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，研究团队在750毫克的扑翼机器人上实现了昆虫般的飞行敏捷性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫飞行的高机动性与现有昆虫级飞行机器人的性能差距，促使研究团队开发更高效的控制器以实现类似昆虫的飞行敏捷性。

Method: 设计了深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，并采用模仿学习方法训练神经网络，以在计算受限的实时系统中实现高反馈率。

Result: 机器人展示了类似昆虫的快速转向动作，速度和加速度分别提高了447%和255%，并能在强风干扰下完成高难度动作。

Conclusion: 该研究在昆虫级飞行敏捷性方面取得了里程碑式的进展，为未来的传感和计算自主性研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking,
saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial
robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body
acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot
inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high
susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers
requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the
hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and
environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube
model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and
robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive
controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To
achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we
design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural
network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of
central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like
saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per
second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$
improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers
under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force
mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11
seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results
represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire
future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.

### [3] [Residual Neural Terminal Constraint for MPC-based Collision Avoidance in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03428)
*Bojan Derajić,Mohamed-Khalil Bouzidi,Sebastian Bernhard,Wolfgang Hönig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合MPC局部规划器，利用学习逼近时间变化的安全集作为MPC终端约束，通过HJ可达性分析实现实时安全估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HJ可达性分析在实时应用中不可行的问题，同时保证安全性。

Method: 利用SDF和神经网络的非负残差函数逼近HJ值函数，并通过超网络参数化提高实时性和泛化能力。

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中，相比三种先进方法，成功率提高30%，计算成本相近且路径质量高。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时性和安全性上表现优异，适用于复杂环境下的路径规划。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a
learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local
observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be
represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time.
We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a
difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a
non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural
network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF,
resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as
the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a
hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties.
The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in
simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates
compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort
and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.

### [4] [Learning User Interaction Forces using Vision for a Soft Finger Exosuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02870)
*Mohamed Irfan Refai,Abdulaziz Y. Alkayas,Anup Teejo Mathew,Federico Renda,Thomas George Thuruthel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像和学习的框架，用于估计手指外骨骼系统的分布式接触力，解决了软性可穿戴设备的建模和传感挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软性可穿戴设备的非线性和柔顺性使得物理建模和嵌入式传感具有挑战性，需要一种新的方法来捕捉动态辅助力的传递。

Method: 使用SoRoSim工具箱生成多样化的外骨骼几何和驱动场景数据集，开发了基于图像和学习的框架，从低分辨率灰度图像中估计接触力。

Result: 方法能够准确估计多个接触点的力，泛化能力强，对视觉噪声和对比度变化具有鲁棒性，并成功集成到反馈控制器中。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为外骨骼实时力估计的非侵入性替代方案，适用于闭环控制。

Abstract: Wearable assistive devices are increasingly becoming softer. Modelling their
interface with human tissue is necessary to capture transmission of dynamic
assistance. However, their nonlinear and compliant nature makes both physical
modeling and embedded sensing challenging. In this paper, we develop a
image-based, learning-based framework to estimate distributed contact forces
for a finger-exosuit system. We used the SoRoSim toolbox to generate a diverse
dataset of exosuit geometries and actuation scenarios for training. The method
accurately estimated interaction forces across multiple contact locations from
low-resolution grayscale images, was able to generalize to unseen shapes and
actuation levels, and remained robust under visual noise and contrast
variations. We integrated the model into a feedback controller, and found that
the vision-based estimator functions as a surrogate force sensor for
closed-loop control. This approach could be used as a non-intrusive alternative
for real-time force estimation for exosuits.

*Isobel Voysey,Lynne Baillie,Joanne Williams,Michael Herrmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过定制化动物形态机器人促进儿童动物福利教育，通过参与式设计工作坊收集了教育者和儿童的需求，总结了机器人的外观、行为和功能设计要点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过机器人帮助儿童学习动物行为，促进安全的儿童与动物互动。

Method: 采用参与式设计工作坊，结合教育者和儿童的意见，分析机器人的外观、行为及功能需求。

Result: 发现负面反应、面部和尾巴特征的重要性，以及自然外观和触感的需求。提出了新的参与式设计活动。

Conclusion: 尽管两组设计概念有重叠，达成共识仍具挑战性，但研究为动物福利教育机器人设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Animal welfare education could greatly benefit from customized robots to help
children learn about animals and their behavior, and thereby promote positive,
safe child-animal interactions. To this end, we ran Participatory Design
workshops with animal welfare educators and children to identify key
requirements for zoomorphic robots from their perspectives. Our findings
encompass a zoomorphic robot's appearance, behavior, and features, as well as
concepts for a narrative surrounding the robot. Through comparing and
contrasting the two groups, we find the importance of: negative reactions to
undesirable behavior from children; using the facial features and tail to
provide cues signaling an animal's internal state; and a natural, furry
appearance and texture. We also contribute some novel activities for
Participatory Design with children, including branching storyboards inspired by
thematic apperception tests and interactive narratives, and reflect on some of
the key design challenges of achieving consensus between the groups, despite
much overlap in their design concepts.

### [6] [Context-aware Risk Assessment and Its Application in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02919)
*Boyang Tian,Weisong Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模块化框架CRI，用于实时风险评估和行为调整，显著提升了自动驾驶的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风险评估方法要么缺乏可解释性，要么未具体整合到自动驾驶系统中，或仅针对特定场景。

Method: CRI基于物体运动学和空间关系量化方向性风险，采用方向感知空间分区、混合概率-最大融合策略和自适应控制策略。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，CRI显著减少了碰撞率并提高了驾驶评分，且运行时开销低。

Conclusion: CRI在复杂高风险环境中显著提升了安全性和鲁棒性，同时保持了模块化和低运行时开销。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk
assessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs
coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes
indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses
narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk
Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks
based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting
control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning
within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)
principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation,
and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate
CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using
a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our
collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions
per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a
17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically
significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6
ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially
improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while
maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.

### [7] [Model-agnostic Meta-learning for Adaptive Gait Phase and Terrain Geometry Estimation with Wearable Soft Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02930)
*Zenan Zhu,Wenxi Chen,Pei-Chun Kao,Janelle Clark,Lily Behnke,Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio,Holly Yanco,Yan Gu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MAML的框架，用于通过少量织物传感器同时准确估计步态和地形，适应性强且泛化能力高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决织物传感器因非线性特性和数据不足带来的估计难题，适应不同用户和地形。

Method: 将MAML集成到深度学习架构中，学习通用模型初始化，实现高效适应和强泛化。

Result: 在九名参与者的实验中，框架在步态、运动模式和倾斜角估计上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在准确性和适应性上表现优异，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: This letter presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based framework
for simultaneous and accurate estimation of human gait phase and terrain
geometry using a small set of fabric-based wearable soft sensors, with
efficient adaptation to unseen subjects and strong generalization across
different subjects and terrains. Compared to rigid alternatives such as
inertial measurement units, fabric-based soft sensors improve comfort but
introduce nonlinearities due to hysteresis, placement error, and fabric
deformation. Moreover, inter-subject and inter-terrain variability, coupled
with limited calibration data in real-world deployments, further complicate
accurate estimation. To address these challenges, the proposed framework
integrates MAML into a deep learning architecture to learn a generalizable
model initialization that captures subject- and terrain-invariant structure.
This initialization enables efficient adaptation (i.e., adaptation with only a
small amount of calibration data and a few fine-tuning steps) to new users,
while maintaining strong generalization (i.e., high estimation accuracy across
subjects and terrains). Experiments on nine participants walking at various
speeds over five terrain conditions demonstrate that the proposed framework
outperforms baseline approaches in estimating gait phase, locomotion mode, and
incline angle, with superior accuracy, adaptation efficiency, and
generalization.

TL;DR: AeroSafe是一种通过机器人咳嗽模拟器和数字孪生技术优化室内空气净化系统的新方法，旨在解决现有便携式空气过滤器忽视咳嗽产生的气溶胶浓度的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内空气质量对健康至关重要，尤其是在高暴露环境中，现有空气过滤器未能有效处理咳嗽产生的气溶胶。

Method: 开发了一个机器人双代理物理模拟器，结合数字孪生模型（物理隔间模型和机器学习方法）预测气溶胶动态。

Result: 模型预测气溶胶浓度的平均停留时间误差在35秒内，实时干预策略优于静态空气过滤器。

Conclusion: AeroSafe系统在减少空气传播病原体风险方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of
occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper
introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor
air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a
digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air
filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by
coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like
healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a
robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin
simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to
aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model,
combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach,
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol
concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35
seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform
static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne
pathogen risks.

Result: 实验表明，该系统在操控精度和微塑料分类准确性上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该机器人平台为微塑料污染监测提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Microplastics, defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters, have
become a pervasive environmental contaminant that accumulates on beaches due to
wind patterns and tidal forcing. Detecting microplastics and mapping their
concentration in the wild remains one of the primary challenges in addressing
this environmental issue. This paper introduces a novel robotic platform that
automatically detects and chemically analyzes microplastics on beach surfaces.
This mobile manipulator system scans areas for microplastics using a camera
mounted on the robotic arm's end effector. The system effectively segments
candidate microplastic particles on sand surfaces even in the presence of
organic matter such as leaves and clams. Once a candidate microplastic particle
is detected, the system steers a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor onto
the particle using both NIR and visual feedback to chemically analyze it in
real-time. Through experiments in lab and beach environments, the system is
shown to achieve an excellent positional precision in manipulation control and
high microplastic classification accuracy.

Result: 提出的简化模型有效解决了蛇形机器人运动中的接触和控制分配问题。

Conclusion: 本文的模型为蛇形机器人运动控制提供了新的理论基础，并通过实验验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Contact-rich problems, such as snake robot locomotion, offer unexplored yet
rich opportunities for optimization-based trajectory and acyclic contact
planning. So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on
emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns
using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or
focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However,
models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are
based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the
challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain
absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations
and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order
model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion
mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including large language models
(LLMs) and hybrid reasoning models present an opportunity to reimagine how
autonomous robots such as drones are designed, developed, and validated. Here,
we demonstrate a fully AI-generated drone control system: with minimal human
input, an artificial intelligence (AI) model authored all the code for a
real-time, self-hosted drone command and control platform, which was deployed
and demonstrated on a real drone in flight as well as a simulated virtual drone
in the cloud. The system enables real-time mapping, flight telemetry,
autonomous mission planning and execution, and safety protocolsall orchestrated
through a web interface hosted directly on the drone itself. Not a single line
of code was written by a human. We quantitatively benchmark system performance,
code complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded
architectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete
command-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles,
though with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context
window and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of
AI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as
emergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work
sets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more
broadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future
robots may be largely co-designed, developed, and verified by artificial
intelligence. In this initial work, a robot built a robot's brain.

Abstract: Object manipulation skills are necessary for robots operating in various
daily-life scenarios, ranging from warehouses to hospitals. They allow the
robots to manipulate the given object to their desired arrangement in the
cluttered environment. The existing approaches to solving object manipulations
are either inefficient sampling based techniques, require expert
demonstrations, or learn by trial and error, making them less ideal for
practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel, multimodal
physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving object manipulation tasks.
Our approach efficiently learns to solve the Eikonal equation without expert
data and finds object manipulation trajectories fast in complex, cluttered
environments. Our method is multimodal as it also reactively replans the
robot's grasps during manipulation to achieve the desired object poses. We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and real-world scenarios and
compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results indicate that
our approach is effective across various objects, has efficient training
compared to previous learning-based methods, and demonstrates high performance
in planning time, trajectory length, and success rates. Our demonstration
videos can be found at https://youtu.be/FaQLkTV9knI.

Abstract: Human-robot object handover is a crucial element for assistive robots that
aim to help people in their daily lives, including elderly care, hospitals, and
factory floors. The existing approaches to solving these tasks rely on
pre-selected target objects and do not contextualize human implicit and
explicit preferences for handover, limiting natural and smooth interaction
between humans and robots. These preferences can be related to the target
object selection from the cluttered environment and to the way the robot should
grasp the selected object to facilitate desirable human grasping during
handovers. Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects
target distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs
the handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit
preferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences.
We evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world
experiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of
these evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in
handling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences. Our
demonstration videos can be found at https://youtu.be/6z27B2INl-s.

TL;DR: 论文研究了两种方法（基于物理的观测器和神经网络回归模型）用于估计仿生扑翼机器人Aerobat的气动力，并验证了其准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确估计气动力对扑翼机器人的控制、建模和设计至关重要，尤其是实现闭环飞行控制。

Method: 1. 基于哈密顿力学的物理观测器，利用共轭动量推断气动力；2. 多层感知机（MLP）神经网络回归模型，从运动学和环境参数映射到气动力。

Result: 两种方法在三个力分量（Fx, Fy, Fz）上表现出高度一致性。

Conclusion: 两种方法均能有效估计气动力，为扑翼机器人的闭环控制提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of aerodynamic forces is essential for advancing the
control, modeling, and design of flapping-wing aerial robots with dynamic
morphing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate two distinct methodologies
for force estimation on Aerobat, a bio-inspired flapping-wing platform designed
to emulate the inertial and aerodynamic behaviors observed in bat flight. Our
goal is to quantify aerodynamic force contributions during tethered flight, a
crucial step toward closed-loop flight control. The first method is a
physics-based observer derived from Hamiltonian mechanics that leverages the
concept of conjugate momentum to infer external aerodynamic forces acting on
the robot. This observer builds on the system's reduced-order dynamic model and
utilizes real-time sensor data to estimate forces without requiring training
data. The second method employs a neural network-based regression model,
specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to learn a mapping from joint
kinematics, flapping frequency, and environmental parameters to aerodynamic
force outputs. We evaluate both estimators using a 6-axis load cell in a
high-frequency data acquisition setup that enables fine-grained force
measurements during periodic wingbeats. The conjugate momentum observer and the
regression model demonstrate strong agreement across three force components
(Fx, Fy, Fz).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning（GACL）的框架，用于机器人课程学习，解决了手动设计课程和复杂任务空间的挑战，并在导航和四足机器人任务中取得了优于现有方法的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人课程学习依赖手动设计，工程量大且可能主观或不优。自动课程学习在简单领域有效，但机器人任务复杂且目标分布部分未知，需要新方法。

Method: GACL框架包含三个创新：1) 处理复杂任务的任务表示；2) 自适应课程生成的性能跟踪机制；3) 通过交替采样保持目标相关性的接地方法。

Result: 在受限环境中的轮式导航和3D狭窄空间中的四足机器人运动任务中，GACL分别比现有方法提高了6.8%和6.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: GACL为机器人课程学习提供了有效的自动化框架，解决了复杂任务空间和目标分布的部分未知问题，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex
robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually
designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer
from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum
learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where
task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique
challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining
relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through
limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning,
a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three
key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex
robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows
adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current
capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain
relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks.
We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and
quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1%
higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each
domain.

Result: 仿真和硬件实验表明，带CRD的解耦控制器在推恢复和步态稳定性上优于无CRD的控制器。

Conclusion: 解耦控制架构结合CRD能有效解决轻量执行器带宽限制，提升机器人动态性能。

Abstract: Husky Carbon, a robot developed by Northeastern University, serves as a
research platform to explore unification of posture manipulation and thrust
vectoring. Unlike conventional quadrupeds, its joint actuators and thrusters
enable enhanced control authority, facilitating thruster-assisted narrow-path
walking. While a unified Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework optimizing
both ground reaction forces and thruster forces could theoretically address
this control problem, its feasibility is limited by the low torque-control
bandwidth of the system's lightweight actuators. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a decoupled control architecture: a Raibert-type controller governs
legged locomotion using position-based control, while an MPC regulates the
thrusters augmented by learned Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD) to account for
leg-ground impacts. This separation bypasses the torque-control rate bottleneck
while retaining the thruster MPC to explicitly account for leg-ground impact
dynamics through learned residuals. We validate this approach through both
simulation and hardware experiments, showing that the decoupled control
architecture with CRD performs more stable behavior in terms of push recovery
and cat-like walking gait compared to the decoupled controller without CRD.

TL;DR: LiGen是一种新型室内定位系统，利用环境光的光谱强度模式作为指纹，通过GAN数据增强和MLP模型实现高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wi-Fi定位系统易受环境影响，LiGen提出更稳定的光指纹替代方案。

Method: 使用GAN生成增强数据（PointGAN和FreeGAN），MLP模型训练合成数据。

Result: LiGen达到亚米级精度，优于Wi-Fi基线50%以上，且在复杂环境中表现稳健。

Conclusion: LiGen首次结合光谱指纹与GAN数据增强，为室内定位提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate and robust indoor localization is critical for smart building
applications, yet existing Wi-Fi-based systems are often vulnerable to
environmental conditions. This work presents a novel indoor localization
system, called LiGen, that leverages the spectral intensity patterns of ambient
light as fingerprints, offering a more stable and infrastructure-free
alternative to radio signals. To address the limited spectral data, we design a
data augmentation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs),
featuring two variants: PointGAN, which generates fingerprints conditioned on
coordinates, and FreeGAN, which uses a weak localization model to label
unconditioned samples. Our positioning model, leveraging a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) architecture to train on synthesized data, achieves
submeter-level accuracy, outperforming Wi-Fi-based baselines by over 50\%.
LiGen also demonstrates strong robustness in cluttered environments. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first system to combine spectral
fingerprints with GAN-based data augmentation for indoor localization.

TL;DR: CogniPlan是一个新的路径规划框架，利用生成模型预测多种可能的布局，结合图注意力路径规划，显著提升探索和导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动机器人在未知环境中路径规划的挑战，特别是自主探索和点目标导航的耦合任务。

Result: 在多个数据集和实际场景中表现优异，超越现有先进规划器。

Conclusion: CogniPlan结合生成模型和图表示，实现了高效、可扩展的路径规划，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Path planning in unknown environments is a crucial yet inherently challenging
capability for mobile robots, which primarily encompasses two coupled tasks:
autonomous exploration and point-goal navigation. In both cases, the robot must
perceive the environment, update its belief, and accurately estimate potential
information gain on-the-fly to guide planning. In this work, we propose
CogniPlan, a novel path planning framework that leverages multiple plausible
layouts predicted by a COnditional GeNerative Inpainting model, mirroring how
humans rely on cognitive maps during navigation. These predictions, based on
the partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning vectors, enable our
planner to reason effectively under uncertainty. We demonstrate strong synergy
between generative image-based layout prediction and graph-attention-based path
planning, allowing CogniPlan to combine the scalability of graph
representations with the fidelity and predictiveness of occupancy maps,
yielding notable performance gains in both exploration and navigation. We
extensively evaluate CogniPlan on two datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic
floor plans), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art planners. We further
deploy it in a high-fidelity simulator and on hardware, showcasing its
high-quality path planning and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于手绘草图导航的任务SkeNa，并发布了大规模数据集SoR。通过自动化草图生成管道和导航框架SkeNavigator，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>

Motivation: 受人类导航策略启发，研究如何在未见环境中仅凭手绘草图实现导航。

Method: 开发自动化草图生成管道，构建数据集SoR；提出SkeNavigator框架，结合RMD和DAGP技术。

Result: SkeNavigator在高度抽象的验证集上相对提升了105%的SPL。

Conclusion: SkeNa任务和SoR数据集为未来研究提供了新方向，SkeNavigator框架表现出色。

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route
maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch
map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an
agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch
map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale
dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71
indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying
levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their
preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future
research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline
that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve
SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual
observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a
Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature
representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To
improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor
(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site
constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide
navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a
large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%
relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

Result: 在仿真和现实环境中验证了人形机器人在复杂环境中的导航和抓取能力。

Conclusion: HEAD框架通过模块化设计成功实现了人形机器人在复杂环境中的高效学习和任务执行。

Abstract: We propose Hand-Eye Autonomous Delivery (HEAD), a framework that learns
navigation, locomotion, and reaching skills for humanoids, directly from human
motion and vision perception data. We take a modular approach where the
high-level planner commands the target position and orientation of the hands
and eyes of the humanoid, delivered by the low-level policy that controls the
whole-body movements. Specifically, the low-level whole-body controller learns
to track the three points (eyes, left hand, and right hand) from existing
large-scale human motion capture data while high-level policy learns from human
data collected by Aria glasses. Our modular approach decouples the ego-centric
vision perception from physical actions, promoting efficient learning and
scalability to novel scenes. We evaluate our method both in simulation and in
the real-world, demonstrating humanoid's capabilities to navigate and reach in
complex environments designed for humans.

Result: 发现Cassie与人类跑步步态在关键特性上高度相似，并成功创造了双足机器人100米短跑的世界纪录。

Conclusion: 研究证明了双足机器人跑步步态优化的可行性及其与人类跑步力学的相似性，为机器人运动控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot
Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait
efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely
high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting
gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly
efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct
this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that
despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of
the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third
contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller
that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including
starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller
on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a
Bipedal Robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人需在未见环境中执行零样本任务，但现有方法因2D语义模糊难以精确定位3D动作点。

Method: 提出3D相关性场，结合多视角聚合和轻量级2D点级指导，直接推理3D空间上下文。

Result: 系统能在20秒内生成空间响应，支持实际操控任务。

Conclusion: Point2Act通过高效3D定位和快速响应，为机器人任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Point2Act, which directly retrieves the 3D action point relevant
for a contextually described task, leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Foundation models opened the possibility for generalist robots that
can perform a zero-shot task following natural language descriptions within an
unseen environment. While the semantics obtained from large-scale image and
language datasets provide contextual understanding in 2D images, the rich yet
nuanced features deduce blurry 2D regions and struggle to find precise 3D
locations for actions. Our proposed 3D relevancy fields bypass the
high-dimensional features and instead efficiently imbue lightweight 2D
point-level guidance tailored to the task-specific action. The multi-view
aggregation effectively compensates for misalignments due to geometric
ambiguities, such as occlusion, or semantic uncertainties inherent in the
language descriptions. The output region is highly localized, reasoning
fine-grained 3D spatial context that can directly transfer to an explicit
position for physical action at the on-the-fly reconstruction of the scene. Our
full-stack pipeline, which includes capturing, MLLM querying, 3D
reconstruction, and grasp pose extraction, generates spatially grounded
responses in under 20 seconds, facilitating practical manipulation tasks.

Result: 在四足机器人运动和视觉导航仿真及四旋翼实验中验证了安全性和任务性能的提升。

Conclusion: MPC-SafeGIL通过扰动增强安全性，适用于复杂系统，提升了模仿学习的实用性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning has provided a promising approach to learning complex
robot behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, learned policies can make
errors that lead to safety violations, which limits their deployment in
safety-critical applications. We propose MPC-SafeGIL, a design-time approach
that enhances the safety of imitation learning by injecting adversarial
disturbances during expert demonstrations. This exposes the expert to a broader
range of safety-critical scenarios and allows the imitation policy to learn
robust recovery behaviors. Our method uses sampling-based Model Predictive
Control (MPC) to approximate worst-case disturbances, making it scalable to
high-dimensional and black-box dynamical systems. In contrast to prior work
that relies on analytical models or interactive experts, MPC-SafeGIL integrates
safety considerations directly into data collection. We validate our approach
through extensive simulations including quadruped locomotion and visuomotor
navigation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor, demonstrating
improvements in both safety and task performance. See our website here:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的零样本语言成本映射框架，用于机器人主动预测和规避动态风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航系统依赖静态地图，难以应对动态风险（如突然出现的行人），导致反应式而非预测式行为。

Method: 利用VLMs解析视觉场景，评估动态风险，并预分配风险感知导航成本，结合几何障碍地图实现主动规划。

Result: 在模拟和多样动态环境中的实验表明，该方法显著提高了导航成功率并减少了危险遭遇。

Conclusion: 语言成本映射框架为机器人提供了预测动态风险的能力，优于传统反应式规划器。

Abstract: Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively
anticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional
navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for
dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a
result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when
handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language
models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive
hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping
framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential
dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling
robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this
language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only
identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around
potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated
and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters,
compared to reactive baseline planners. Code and supplementary materials are

Motivation: 现有基准测试多关注短期任务和粗粒度动作，无法满足复杂长期任务的需求，因此需要开发更贴近现实的长期规划基准。

Method: 利用Unity引擎构建高保真模拟环境，设计两阶段任务（意图识别和具身交互），并提供统一API工具集支持宏操作和细粒度动作。

Result: 揭示了当前大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂长期任务中的主要不足，并提供了开放基准以促进研究。

Conclusion: CookBench填补了长期规划任务的空白，为未来研究提供了实用工具和挑战方向。

Abstract: Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of
executing long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing
embodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and
coarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce
CookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios.
By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful
Unity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic
environment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process.
First, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's
complex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the
identified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of
physical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the
action granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational
information while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We
provide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified
API supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing
ingredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical
interaction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and
decision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of
state-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model,
revealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex,
long-horizon tasks. The full benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate
future research.

Conclusion: 系统成功整合了力顺应、自主导航和避障，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Guiding the visually impaired in complex environments requires real-time
two-way interaction and safety assurance. We propose a Force-Compliance Model
Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for
force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots.
FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and
moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS)
method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User
CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and
dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility
issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected
DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from
O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on
resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum
Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman
filtering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates
force compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental
results demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while
guaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex
environments.

Conclusion: UniFucGrasp克服了灵巧抓取中标注成本和泛化挑战，为功能性抓取提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly
emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like
opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and
hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's
underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp
annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on
biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses
geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps.
This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality
functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp
dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness.
Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that
our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability,
enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes
annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping. The

Motivation: 水下机器人在浑浊水域中导航时，单目视觉重建方法不可靠且缺乏深度信息，而声纳分辨率低且有高度模糊性。

Method: 通过识别视觉数据中的感兴趣区域，并将其与声纳数据匹配，利用声纳的距离信息和相机的高度数据进行重建。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在不同浑浊度下的有效性，并在码头环境中进行了实地测试。

Conclusion: 该方法在浑浊水域中表现优异，代码已开源以促进复现和社区参与。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction is an essential capability for underwater robots
navigating in close proximity to structures. Monocular vision-based
reconstruction methods are unreliable in turbid waters and lack depth scale
information. Sonars are robust to turbid water and non-uniform lighting
conditions, however, they have low resolution and elevation ambiguity. This
work proposes a real-time opti-acoustic scene reconstruction method that is
specially optimized to work in turbid water. Our strategy avoids having to
identify point features in visual data and instead identifies regions of
interest in the data. We then match relevant regions in the image to
corresponding sonar data. A reconstruction is obtained by leveraging range data
from the sonar and elevation data from the camera image. Experimental
comparisons against other vision-based and sonar-based approaches at varying
turbidity levels, and field tests conducted in marina environments, validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We have made our code open-source
to facilitate reproducibility and encourage community engagement.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose theatre-in-the-loop, a framework for developing
expressive robot behaviours tailored to artistic performance through a
director-guided puppeteering workflow. Leveraging theatrical methods, we use
narrative objectives to direct a puppeteer in generating improvised robotic
gestures that convey specific emotions. These improvisations are captured and
curated to build a dataset of reusable movement templates for standalone
playback in future autonomous performances. Initial trials demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach, illustrating how the workflow enables precise
sculpting of robotic gestures into coherent emotional arcs while revealing
challenges posed by the robot's mechanical constraints. We argue that this
practice-led framework provides a model for interdisciplinary teams creating
socially expressive robot behaviours, contributing to (1) theatre as an
interactive training ground for human-robot interaction and (2) co-creation
methodologies between humans and machines.

Result: 实验显示在不同机器人数量、物体和任务中成功率为52%，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: CollaBot框架在多机器人协作搬运任务中表现出潜力，为通用化协作操纵提供了可行方案。

Abstract: A central research topic in robotics is how to use this system to interact
with the physical world. Traditional manipulation tasks primarily focus on
small objects. However, in factory or home environments, there is often a need
for the movement of large objects, such as moving tables. These tasks typically
require multi-robot systems to work collaboratively. Previous research lacks a
framework that can scale to arbitrary sizes of robots and generalize to various
kinds of tasks. In this work, we propose CollaBot, a generalist framework for
simultaneous collaborative manipulation. First, we use SEEM for scene
segmentation and point cloud extraction of the target object. Then, we propose
a collaborative grasping framework, which decomposes the task into local grasp
pose generation and global collaboration. Finally, we design a 2-stage planning
module that can generate collision-free trajectories to achieve this task.
Experiments show a success rate of 52% across different numbers of robots,
objects, and tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: The integration of Automated Delivery Robots (ADRs) into pedestrian-heavy
urban spaces introduces unique challenges in terms of safe, efficient, and
socially acceptable navigation. We develop the complete pipeline for a single
vision sensor based multi-pedestrian detection and tracking, pose estimation,
and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset

system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware

Abstract: Vibration suppression is an important capability for collaborative robots
deployed in challenging environments such as construction sites. We study the
active suppression of vibration caused by external sources such as power tools.
We adopt the band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) algorithm to
learn the vibration online and counter it by feedforward force control. We
propose the damped BMFLC method, extending BMFLC with a novel adaptive
step-size approach that improves the convergence time and noise resistance. Our
logistic function-based damping mechanism reduces the effect of noise and
enables larger learning rates. We evaluate our method on extensive simulation
experiments with realistic time-varying multi-frequency vibration and
real-world physical interaction experiments. The simulation experiments show
that our method improves the suppression rate in comparison to the original
BMFLC and its recursive least squares and Kalman filter-based extensions.
Furthermore, our method is far more efficient than the latter two. We further
validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world polishing experiments. A

Result: 在T型迷宫导航任务中验证了混合GA-海布控制器的有效性，成功应对光线变化和障碍。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人提供了一种动态适应能力，同时保留了核心知识，适用于多变环境。

Abstract: Imagine a robot controller with the ability to adapt like human synapses,
dynamically rewiring itself to overcome unforeseen challenges in real time.
This paper proposes a novel zero-shot adaptation mechanism for evolutionary
robotics, merging a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) controller with online
Hebbian plasticity. Inspired by biological systems, the method separates
learning and memory, with the genotype acting as memory and Hebbian updates
handling learning. In our approach, the fitness function is leveraged as a live
scaling factor for Hebbian learning, enabling the robot's neural controller to
adjust synaptic weights on-the-fly without additional training. This adds a
dynamic adaptive layer that activates only during runtime to handle unexpected
environmental changes. After the task, the robot 'forgets' the temporary
adjustments and reverts to the original weights, preserving core knowledge. We
validate this hybrid GA-Hebbian controller on an e-puck robot in a T-maze
navigation task with changing light conditions and obstacles.

Conclusion: DiWA首次实现了基于离线世界模型的扩散策略微调，为实际机器人学习提供了更高效、更安全的方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents
significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction
impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require
millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical
fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion
policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong
dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for
fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement
learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment
interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective
adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline
play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,
making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot
learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across
eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude
fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world
robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly
available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Inland-LOAM 是一个针对内河水道的 LiDAR SLAM 框架，通过改进特征提取和水面平面约束减少垂直漂移，并生成语义地图以支持自主导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水道地图缺乏实时细节，传统 LiDAR SLAM 在水道环境中表现不佳，导致垂直漂移和非语义地图，阻碍自主导航。

Method: 提出 Inland-LOAM，结合改进的特征提取、水面平面约束和体素几何分析，将 3D 点云转换为结构化 2D 语义地图，并自动提取岸线。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，Inland-LOAM 定位精度优于现有方法，生成的语义地图和岸线与实际情况一致。

Conclusion: Inland-LOAM 为内河水道自主导航提供了可靠的地理空间信息，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Accurate geospatial information is crucial for safe, autonomous Inland
Waterway Transport (IWT), as existing charts (IENC) lack real-time detail and
conventional LiDAR SLAM fails in waterway environments. These challenges lead
to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation.
  This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It
uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to
mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into
structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling
real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An
automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight,
IENC-compatible format.
  Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior
localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic
maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data
for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly
available
