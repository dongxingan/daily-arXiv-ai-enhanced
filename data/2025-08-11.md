### [1] [GPU-Accelerated Barrier-Rate Guided MPPI Control for Tractor-Trailer Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05773)
*Keyvan Majd,Hardik Parwana,Bardh Hoxha,Steven Hong,Hideki Okamoto,Georgios Fainekos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BR-MPPI方法通过结合控制屏障函数（CBF）约束，提升了MPPI在复杂环境中的导航能力，并在高保真模拟器中验证了其高效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决铰接式车辆（如拖车、堆场卡车等）在拥挤空间中倒车和机动时的导航挑战，尤其是在行人存在的情况下。

Method: 将控制屏障函数（CBF）约束直接嵌入路径积分更新中，引导重要性采样分布朝向无碰撞且动态可行的轨迹。

Result: 在CarMaker模拟器中，BR-MPPI在12米拖车倒车和前进停车任务中表现出色，计算速度超过100Hz，停车间隙优于标准MPPI和带碰撞成本的MPPI基线。

Conclusion: BR-MPPI通过增强探索能力和轨迹鲁棒性，为复杂环境中的车辆导航提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Articulated vehicles such as tractor-trailers, yard trucks, and similar
platforms must often reverse and maneuver in cluttered spaces where pedestrians
are present. We present how Barrier-Rate guided Model Predictive Path Integral
(BR-MPPI) control can solve navigation in such challenging environments.
BR-MPPI embeds Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints directly into the
path-integral update. By steering the importance-sampling distribution toward
collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories, BR-MPPI enhances the
exploration strength of MPPI and improves robustness of resulting trajectories.
The method is evaluated in the high-fidelity CarMaker simulator on a 12 [m]
tractor-trailer tasked with reverse and forward parking in a parking lot.
BR-MPPI computes control inputs in above 100 [Hz] on a single GPU (for
scenarios with eight obstacles) and maintains better parking clearance than a
standard MPPI baseline and an MPPI with collision cost baseline.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that integrates vision foundation models
with reinforcement learning to enhance object interaction capabilities in
simulated environments. By combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and
YOLOv5 with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent operating in the
AI2-THOR simulation environment, we enable the agent to perceive and interact
with objects more effectively. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across
four diverse indoor kitchen settings, demonstrate significant improvements in
object interaction success rates and navigation efficiency compared to a
baseline agent without advanced perception. The results show a 68% increase in
average cumulative reward, a 52.5% improvement in object interaction success
rate, and a 33% increase in navigation efficiency. These findings highlight the
potential of integrating foundation models with reinforcement learning for
complex robotic tasks, paving the way for more sophisticated and capable
autonomous agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统刚性夹具难以适应小型家电的复杂曲面几何形状，导致拆卸任务效率低下。

Method: 开发了稳定性感知规划框架，通过采样目标物体底面、筛选接触点并评估支撑配置，优化夹具部署。

Result: 与传统刚性夹具相比，新系统在螺丝拆卸任务中表现出更高的成功率和稳定性。

Conclusion: 模块化真空夹具系统显著提升了复杂几何形状家电的拆卸效率和稳定性。

Abstract: The disassembly of small household appliances poses significant challenges
due to their complex and curved geometries, which render traditional rigid
fixtures inadequate. In this paper, we propose a modular vacuum-based fixturing
system that leverages commercially available balloon-type soft grippers to
conform to arbitrarily shaped surfaces and provide stable support during
screw-removal tasks. To enable a reliable deployment of the system, we develop
a stability-aware planning framework that samples the bottom surface of the
target object, filters candidate contact points based on geometric continuity,
and evaluates support configurations using convex hull-based static stability
criteria. We compare the quality of object placement under different numbers
and configurations of balloon hands. In addition, real-world experiments were
conducted to compare the success rates of traditional rigid fixtures with our
proposed system. The results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
higher success rates and superior placement stability during screw removal
tasks.

Conclusion: 该系统为复杂拆卸任务提供了一种直观且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic non-destructive disassembly of mating parts remains challenging due
to the need for flexible manipulation and the limited visibility of internal
structures. This study presents an affordance-guided teleoperation system that
enables intuitive human demonstrations for dual-arm fix-and-disassemble tasks
for mating parts. The system visualizes feasible grasp poses and disassembly
directions in a virtual environment, both derived from the object's geometry,
to address occlusions and structural complexity. To prevent excessive position
tracking under load when following the affordance, we integrate a hybrid
controller that combines position and impedance control into the teleoperated
disassembly arm. Real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the
proposed system, showing improved task success rates and reduced object pose

### [5] [Latent Policy Barrier: Learning Robust Visuomotor Policies by Staying In-Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05941)
*Zhanyi Sun,Shuran Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Latent Policy Barrier (LPB) 是一种通过分离专家模仿和OOD恢复的框架，提升视觉运动策略的鲁棒性和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆训练的视觉运动策略容易受到协变量偏移的影响，常见缓解方法（如人工干预或数据增强）成本高或效果有限。

Method: LPB 将专家演示的潜在嵌入视为隐式屏障，分为基础扩散策略和动态模型两部分，分别处理专家模仿和OOD恢复。

Result: 实验表明，LPB 在模拟和真实场景中均提高了策略的鲁棒性和数据效率。

Conclusion: LPB 能够仅依赖有限专家数据实现可靠操作，无需额外人工干预。

Abstract: Visuomotor policies trained via behavior cloning are vulnerable to covariate
shift, where small deviations from expert trajectories can compound into
failure. Common strategies to mitigate this issue involve expanding the
training distribution through human-in-the-loop corrections or synthetic data
augmentation. However, these approaches are often labor-intensive, rely on
strong task assumptions, or compromise the quality of imitation. We introduce
Latent Policy Barrier, a framework for robust visuomotor policy learning.
Inspired by Control Barrier Functions, LPB treats the latent embeddings of
expert demonstrations as an implicit barrier separating safe, in-distribution
states from unsafe, out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Our approach decouples the
role of precise expert imitation and OOD recovery into two separate modules: a
base diffusion policy solely on expert data, and a dynamics model trained on
both expert and suboptimal policy rollout data. At inference time, the dynamics
model predicts future latent states and optimizes them to stay within the
expert distribution. Both simulated and real-world experiments show that LPB
improves both policy robustness and data efficiency, enabling reliable
manipulation from limited expert data and without additional human correction
or annotation.

Motivation: 许多博物馆，尤其是低人口密度地区的博物馆，存在可访问性障碍，项目希望通过技术手段改善这一问题。

Method: 项目以三个博物馆为案例研究，探索机器人作为导览和远程访问工具的应用，涉及讲故事、机器人个性化和协作等研究主题。

Result: 项目提出机器人可作为导览支持包容性访问，或作为远程访问工具帮助行动不便者。

Conclusion: 通过社交机器人技术，小型博物馆的可访问性有望显著提升。

Abstract: There are still many museums that present accessibility barriers,
particularly regarding perceptual, cultural, and cognitive aspects. This is
especially evident in low-density population areas. The aim of the ROBSO-PM
project is to improve the accessibility of small museums through the use of
social robots and social telepresence robots, focusing on three museums as case
studies: the Museum of the Holy Shroud in Turin, a small but globally known
institution, and two lesser known mountain museums: the Museum of the Champlas
du Col Carnival and the Pragelato Museum of Alpine Peoples' Costumes and
Traditions. The project explores two main applications for robots: as guides
supporting inclusive visits for foreign or disabled visitors, and as
telepresence tools allowing people with limited mobility to access museums
remotely. From a research perspective, key topics include storytelling, robot
personality, empathy, personalization, and, in the case of telepresence,
collaboration between the robot and the person, with clearly defined roles and
autonomy.

### [7] [Dynamical Trajectory Planning of Disturbance Consciousness for Air-Land Bimodal Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05972)
*Shaoting Liu,Zhou Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种扰动感知的规划框架，通过实时扰动估计优化路径搜索和轨迹规划，提升双模态车辆在复杂环境中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双模态车辆结合了空中和地面移动的优势，但环境扰动会影响轨迹规划的鲁棒性，因此需要一种扰动感知的规划方法。

Method: 采用扰动自适应安全边界调整机制，基于实时扰动估计动态调整车辆的可行动态边界，并结合车辆动力学模型进行运动规划。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在跟踪精度、任务效率和能源性能上的提升，尤其是在地面和空中扰动下的表现。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了双模态车辆在复杂环境中的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Air-land bimodal vehicles provide a promising solution for navigating complex
environments by combining the flexibility of aerial locomotion with the energy
efficiency of ground mobility. To enhance the robustness of trajectory planning
under environmental disturbances, this paper presents a disturbance-aware
planning framework that incorporates real-time disturbance estimation into both
path searching and trajectory optimization. A key component of the framework is
a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism, which dynamically
modifies the vehicle's feasible dynamic boundaries based on estimated
disturbances to ensure trajectory feasibility. Leveraging the dynamics model of
the bimodal vehicle, the proposed approach achieves adaptive and reliable
motion planning across different terrains and operating conditions. A series of
real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons on a custom-built platform
validate the effectiveness and robustness of the method, demonstrating
improvements in tracking accuracy, task efficiency, and energy performance
under both ground and aerial disturbances.

### [8] [ReNiL: Relative Neural Inertial Locator with Any-Scale Bayesian Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06053)
*Kaixuan Wu,Yuanzhuo Xu,Zejun Zhang,Weiping Zhu,Steve Drew,Xiaoguang Niu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReNiL是一个基于贝叶斯深度学习的框架，用于高效、准确且具有不确定性感知的行人惯性定位。它通过IPDPs和ASLE技术，解决了传统方法在运动尺度和步频适应性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法在惯性定位中存在固定滑动窗口集成、难以适应多样化运动尺度和步频的问题，且不确定性估计不一致，限制了实际应用。

Method: ReNiL引入IPDPs来估计上下文有意义的路径点运动，结合ASLE网络（融合自监督和贝叶斯回归）和运动感知方向滤波器，提供均匀的欧几里得不确定性。

Result: 在RoNIN-ds和WUDataset上，ReNiL在位移精度和不确定性一致性上达到最优，计算量更低，优于TLIO、CTIN等方法。

Conclusion: ReNiL为移动和IoT定位提供了可扩展、不确定性感知的基础，具有实际应用的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Pedestrian inertial localization is key for mobile and IoT services because
it provides infrastructure-free positioning. Yet most learning-based methods
depend on fixed sliding-window integration, struggle to adapt to diverse motion
scales and cadences, and yield inconsistent uncertainty, limiting real-world
use. We present ReNiL, a Bayesian deep-learning framework for accurate,
efficient, and uncertainty-aware pedestrian localization. ReNiL introduces
Inertial Positioning Demand Points (IPDPs) to estimate motion at contextually
meaningful waypoints instead of dense tracking, and supports inference on IMU
sequences at any scale so cadence can match application needs. It couples a
motion-aware orientation filter with an Any-Scale Laplace Estimator (ASLE), a
dual-task network that blends patch-based self-supervision with Bayesian
regression. By modeling displacements with a Laplace distribution, ReNiL
provides homogeneous Euclidean uncertainty that integrates cleanly with other
sensors. A Bayesian inference chain links successive IPDPs into consistent
trajectories. On RoNIN-ds and a new WUDataset covering indoor and outdoor
motion from 28 participants, ReNiL achieves state-of-the-art displacement
accuracy and uncertainty consistency, outperforming TLIO, CTIN, iMoT, and RoNIN
variants while reducing computation. Application studies further show
robustness and practicality for mobile and IoT localization, making ReNiL a
scalable, uncertainty-aware foundation for next-generation positioning.

### [9] [Incremental Language Understanding for Online Motion Planning of Robot Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06095)
*Mitchell Abrams,Thies Oelerich,Christian Hartl-Nesic,Andreas Kugi,Matthias Scheutz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理的增量解析器，将在线运动规划算法集成到认知架构中，实现动态语言输入的实时适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设指令完全明确，导致修正或澄清时需停止并重新规划，效率低下。

Method: 结合符号推理与在线运动规划，维护多个候选解析，动态调整运动计划。

Result: 在真实人机交互场景中验证了系统对目标位姿、约束或任务目标的在线适应能力。

Conclusion: 增量语言理解与实时运动规划的结合提升了人机协作的自然性和流畅性。

Abstract: Human-robot interaction requires robots to process language incrementally,
adapting their actions in real-time based on evolving speech input. Existing
approaches to language-guided robot motion planning typically assume fully
specified instructions, resulting in inefficient stop-and-replan behavior when
corrections or clarifications occur. In this paper, we introduce a novel
reasoning-based incremental parser which integrates an online motion planning
algorithm within the cognitive architecture. Our approach enables continuous
adaptation to dynamic linguistic input, allowing robots to update motion plans
without restarting execution. The incremental parser maintains multiple
candidate parses, leveraging reasoning mechanisms to resolve ambiguities and
revise interpretations when needed. By combining symbolic reasoning with online
motion planning, our system achieves greater flexibility in handling speech
corrections and dynamically changing constraints. We evaluate our framework in
real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, demonstrating online adaptions of
goal poses, constraints, or task objectives. Our results highlight the
advantages of integrating incremental language understanding with real-time
motion planning for natural and fluid human-robot collaboration. The
experiments are demonstrated in the accompanying video at
www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d5.

### [10] [Bounding Distributional Shifts in World Modeling through Novelty Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06096)
*Eric Jing,Abdeslam Boularias*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于变分自编码器的新颖性检测方法，用于增强视觉世界模型的鲁棒性，提高数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉世界模型对训练质量敏感，需要近乎完整的动作和状态空间覆盖以防止推理时发散。

Method: 使用变分自编码器作为新颖性检测器，确保规划中的动作轨迹不偏离训练数据分布，并将其集成到DINO-WM架构的模型预测控制策略中。

Result: 在模拟机器人环境中的实验表明，该方法在数据效率上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了视觉世界模型的鲁棒性和数据效率。

Abstract: Recent work on visual world models shows significant promise in latent state
dynamics obtained from pre-trained image backbones. However, most of the
current approaches are sensitive to training quality, requiring near-complete
coverage of the action and state space during training to prevent divergence
during inference. To make a model-based planning algorithm more robust to the
quality of the learned world model, we propose in this work to use a
variational autoencoder as a novelty detector to ensure that proposed action
trajectories during planning do not cause the learned model to deviate from the
training data distribution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a
series of experiments in challenging simulated robot environments was carried
out, with the proposed method incorporated into a model-predictive control
policy loop extending the DINO-WM architecture. The results clearly show that
the proposed method improves over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of data
efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HyperPM的新方法，通过时间依赖的动态模型解决现有梯度MPC中动态模型的局限性，显著减少了长期预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有梯度MPC中的动态模型受限于计算复杂性和状态表示，无法准确预测未建模的动态现象。

Method: 提出HyperPM，将未建模动态投影到时间依赖的动态模型上，通过神经网络学习时间变化参数。

Result: 在F1TENTH自动驾驶赛车等挑战性系统中，HyperPM显著减少了长期预测误差，并在MPC框架（HyperMPC）中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: HyperPM在保持计算效率和鲁棒性的同时，提高了动态模型的预测能力，为机器人控制提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is among the most widely adopted and reliable
methods for robot control, relying critically on an accurate dynamics model.
However, existing dynamics models used in the gradient-based MPC are limited by
computational complexity and state representation. To address this limitation,
we propose the Hyper Prediction Model (HyperPM) - a novel approach in which we
project the unmodeled dynamics onto a time-dependent dynamics model. This
time-dependency is captured through time-varying model parameters, whose
evolution over the MPC prediction horizon is learned using a neural network.
Such formulation preserves the computational efficiency and robustness of the
base model while equipping it with the capacity to anticipate previously
unmodeled phenomena. We evaluated the proposed approach on several challenging
systems, including real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, and demonstrated that
it significantly reduces long-horizon prediction errors. Moreover, when
integrated within the MPC framework (HyperMPC), our method consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Affordance-R1是一个统一的affordance grounding框架，结合了认知CoT和GRPO强化学习，提升了OOD泛化和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型缺乏CoT推理能力，限制了泛化和显式推理能力，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 设计了包含格式、感知和认知奖励的affordance函数，并构建了ReasonAff数据集，通过GRPO强化学习训练。

Result: Affordance-R1在零样本泛化和推理能力上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Affordance-R1首次将GRPO强化学习与推理结合，展示了开放世界泛化能力。

Abstract: Affordance grounding focuses on predicting the specific regions of objects
that are associated with the actions to be performed by robots. It plays a
vital role in the fields of human-robot interaction, human-object interaction,
embodied manipulation, and embodied perception. Existing models often neglect
the affordance shared among different objects because they lack the
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning abilities, limiting their out-of-domain (OOD)
generalization and explicit reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding
framework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we
designed a sophisticated affordance function, which contains format,
perception, and cognition rewards to effectively guide optimization directions.
Furthermore, we constructed a high-quality affordance-centric reasoning
dataset, ReasonAff, to support training. Trained exclusively via reinforcement
learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Affordance-R1 achieves
robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning
capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms
well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization. To the best of
our knowledge, Affordance-R1 is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with
reasoning into affordance reasoning. The code of our method and our dataset is
released on https://github.com/hq-King/Affordance-R1.

Conclusion: 智能、情境感知的控制方法在工业外骨骼中具有潜力，验证了所提框架的有效性。

Abstract: Back exoskeletons can reduce musculoskeletal strain, but their effectiveness
depends on support modulation and adaptive control. This study addresses two
challenges: defining optimal support strategies and developing adaptive control
based on payload estimation. We introduce an optimization space based on muscle
activity reduction, perceived discomfort, and user preference, constructing
functions to identify optimal strategies. Experiments with 12 subjects revealed
optimal operating regions, highlighting the need for dynamic modulation. Based
on these insights, we developed a vision-based adaptive control pipeline that
estimates payloads in real-time by enhancing exoskeleton contextual
understanding, minimising latency and enabling support adaptation within the
defined optimisation space. Validation with 12 more subjects showed over 80%
accuracy and improvements across all metrics. Compared to static control,
adaptive modulation reduced peak back muscle activation by up to 23% while
preserving user preference and minimising discomfort. These findings validate
the proposed framework and highlight the potential of intelligent,
context-aware control in industrial exoskeletons.

Result: 实验表明，REBot在避障成功率、能效和对快速移动障碍物的鲁棒性方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: REBot为四足机器人提供了高效的实时反射性避障能力。

Abstract: Dynamic obstacle avoidance (DOA) is critical for quadrupedal robots operating
in environments with moving obstacles or humans. Existing approaches typically
rely on navigation-based trajectory replanning, which assumes sufficient
reaction time and leading to fails when obstacles approach rapidly. In such
scenarios, quadrupedal robots require reflexive evasion capabilities to perform
instantaneous, low-latency maneuvers. This paper introduces Reflexive Evasion
Robot (REBot), a control framework that enables quadrupedal robots to achieve
real-time reflexive obstacle avoidance. REBot integrates an avoidance policy
and a recovery policy within a finite-state machine. With carefully designed
learning curricula and by incorporating regularization and adaptive rewards,
REBot achieves robust evasion and rapid stabilization in instantaneous DOA
tasks. We validate REBot through extensive simulations and real-world
experiments, demonstrating notable improvements in avoidance success rates,
energy efficiency, and robustness to fast-moving obstacles. Videos and appendix
are available on https://rebot-2025.github.io/.

Result: 实验表明，ADP在RLBench、CALVIN和真实数据集上提升了成功率和效率，执行速度提升25%，成功率提高9%。

Conclusion: ADP通过引入先验知识，显著提升了扩散策略的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful class of visuomotor
controllers for robot manipulation, offering stable training and expressive
multi-modal action modeling. However, existing approaches typically treat
action generation as an unconstrained denoising process, ignoring valuable a
priori knowledge about geometry and control structure. In this work, we propose
the Adaptive Diffusion Policy (ADP), a test-time adaptation method that
introduces two key inductive biases into the diffusion. First, we embed a
geometric manifold constraint that aligns denoising updates with task-relevant
subspaces, leveraging the fact that the relative pose between the end-effector
and target scene provides a natural gradient direction, and guiding denoising
along the geodesic path of the manipulation manifold. Then, to reduce
unnecessary exploration and accelerate convergence, we propose an analytically
guided initialization: rather than sampling from an uninformative prior, we
compute a rough registration between the gripper and target scenes to propose a
structured initial noisy action. ADP is compatible with pre-trained diffusion
policies and requires no retraining, enabling test-time adaptation that tailors
the policy to specific tasks, thereby enhancing generalization across novel
tasks and environments. Experiments on RLBench, CALVIN, and real-world dataset
show that ADPro, an implementation of ADP, improves success rates,
generalization, and sampling efficiency, achieving up to 25% faster execution
and 9% points over strong diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了机械臂能耗模型的通用性和精度。

Abstract: Existing literature proposes models for estimating the electrical power of
manipulators, yet two primary limitations prevail. First, most models are
predominantly tested using traditional industrial robots. Second, these models
often lack accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce an open source
Matlab-based library designed to automatically generate \ac{ec} models for
manipulators. The necessary inputs for the library are Denavit-Hartenberg
parameters, link masses, and centers of mass. Additionally, our model is
data-driven and requires real operational data, including joint positions,
velocities, accelerations, electrical power, and corresponding timestamps. We
validated our methodology by testing on four lightweight robots sourced from
three distinct manufacturers: Universal Robots, Franka Emika, and Kinova. The
model underwent testing, and the results demonstrated an RMSE ranging from 1.42
W to 2.80 W for the training dataset and from 1.45 W to 5.25 W for the testing

Result: 在电动汽车电池再制造的案例中，PPR-AKG有效支持资源分配和不良条件的识别与缓解。

Conclusion: PPR-AKG模型和LLM聊天机器人的结合为CPPS提供了多维生产知识和直观的人机交互方式。

Abstract: Contemporary industrial cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) composed of
robotic workcells face significant challenges in the analysis of undesired
conditions due to the flexibility of Industry 4.0 that disrupts traditional
quality assurance mechanisms. This paper presents a novel industry-oriented
semantic model called Product-Process-Resource Asset Knowledge Graph (PPR-AKG),
which is designed to analyze and mitigate undesired conditions in flexible
CPPS. Built on top of the well-proven Product-Process-Resource (PPR) model
originating from ISA-95 and VDI-3682, a comprehensive OWL ontology addresses
shortcomings of conventional model-driven engineering for CPPS, particularly
inadequate undesired condition and error handling representation. The
integration of semantic technologies with large language models (LLMs) provides
intuitive interfaces for factory operators, production planners, and engineers
to interact with the entire model using natural language. Evaluation with the
use case addressing electric vehicle battery remanufacturing demonstrates that
the PPR-AKG approach efficiently supports resource allocation based on
explicitly represented capabilities as well as identification and mitigation of
undesired conditions in production. The key contributions include (1) a
holistic PPR-AKG model capturing multi-dimensional production knowledge, and
(2) the useful combination of the PPR-AKG with LLM-based chatbots for human
interaction.

TL;DR: S-Path利用3D场景图的语义结构提升路径规划效率，通过两阶段规划和动态重规划机制，显著减少规划时间并保持路径最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D场景图的结构未被充分利用于提升路径规划的效率和可解释性，S-Path旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段规划：先在语义图上搜索高层路径，再分解为并行子问题；引入动态重规划机制优化效率。

Result: 实验显示，S-Path平均减少5.7倍规划时间，路径最优性与传统方法相当，复杂场景表现更优。

Conclusion: S-Path是一种高效且可解释的路径规划方法，适用于室内3D场景图环境。

Abstract: 3D Scene Graphs integrate both metric and semantic information, yet their
structure remains underutilized for improving path planning efficiency and
interpretability. In this work, we present S-Path, a situationally-aware path
planner that leverages the metric-semantic structure of indoor 3D Scene Graphs
to significantly enhance planning efficiency. S-Path follows a two-stage
process: it first performs a search over a semantic graph derived from the
scene graph to yield a human-understandable high-level path. This also
identifies relevant regions for planning, which later allows the decomposition
of the problem into smaller, independent subproblems that can be solved in
parallel. We also introduce a replanning mechanism that, in the event of an
infeasible path, reuses information from previously solved subproblems to
update semantic heuristics and prioritize reuse to further improve the
efficiency of future planning attempts. Extensive experiments on both
real-world and simulated environments show that S-Path achieves average
reductions of 5.7x in planning time while maintaining comparable path
optimality to classical sampling-based planners and surpassing them in complex
scenarios, making it an efficient and interpretable path planner for
environments represented by indoor 3D Scene Graphs.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多种交互式机器人任务，仅需原始图像数据。

Abstract: A metric-accurate semantic 3D representation is essential for many robotic
tasks. This work proposes a simple, yet powerful, way to integrate the 2D
embeddings of a Vision-Language Model in a metric-accurate 3D representation at
real-time. We combine a local embedding masking strategy, for a more distinct
embedding distribution, with a confidence-weighted 3D integration for more
reliable 3D embeddings. The resulting metric-accurate embedding representation
is task-agnostic and can represent semantic concepts on a global multi-room, as
well as on a local object-level. This enables a variety of interactive robotic
applications that require the localisation of objects-of-interest via natural
language. We evaluate our approach on a variety of real-world sequences and
demonstrate that these strategies achieve a more accurate object-of-interest
localisation while improving the runtime performance in order to meet our
real-time constraints. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach
in a variety of interactive handheld, mobile robotics and manipulation tasks,
requiring only raw image data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CPU指标忽视了代码对机器人行为的物理影响，本研究旨在通过电力功耗分析更全面地评估程序性能。

Result: 通过UR5e机器人的实验案例研究，比较了四种不同策略的程序，揭示了各策略的优缺点。

Conclusion: 该体现中心方法不仅提升机器人性能，还支持可持续制造和成本降低等工业目标。

Abstract: The code performance of industrial robots is typically analyzed through CPU
metrics, which overlook the physical impact of code on robot behavior. This
study introduces a novel framework for assessing robot program performance from
an embodiment perspective by analyzing the robot's electrical power profile.
Our approach diverges from conventional CPU based evaluations and instead
leverages a suite of normalized metrics, namely, the energy utilization
coefficient, the energy conversion metric, and the reliability coefficient, to
capture how efficiently and reliably energy is used during task execution.
Complementing these metrics, the established robot wear metric provides further
insight into long term reliability. Our approach is demonstrated through an
experimental case study in machine tending, comparing four programs with
diverse strategies using a UR5e robot. The proposed metrics directly compare
and categorize different robot programs, regardless of the specific task, by
linking code performance to its physical manifestation through power
consumption patterns. Our results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each
strategy, offering actionable insights for optimizing robot programming
practices. Enhancing energy efficiency and reliability through this embodiment
centric approach not only improves individual robot performance but also
supports broader industrial objectives such as sustainable manufacturing and
cost reduction.

Result: 在多域仿真和实验验证中，实现了亚厘米级的笛卡尔跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 增强的EMLA模型与VDC方法结合，能够实现全电动HDRM的模块化实时控制。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified system-level modeling and control framework for
an all-electric heavy-duty robotic manipulator (HDRM) driven by
electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs). A surrogate-enhanced actuator
model, combining integrated electromechanical dynamics with a neural network
trained on a dedicated testbed, is integrated into an extended virtual
decomposition control (VDC) architecture augmented by a natural adaptation law.
The derived analytical HDRM model supports a hierarchical control structure
that seamlessly maps high-level force and velocity objectives to real-time
actuator commands, accompanied by a Lyapunov-based stability proof. In
multi-domain simulations of both cubic and a custom planar triangular
trajectory, the proposed adaptive modular controller achieves sub-centimeter
Cartesian tracking accuracy. Experimental validation of the same 1-DoF platform
under realistic load emulation confirms the efficacy of the proposed control
strategy. These findings demonstrate that a surrogate-enhanced EMLA model
embedded in the VDC approach can enable modular, real-time control of an
all-electric HDRM, supporting its deployment in next-generation mobile working
machines.

Conclusion: 通过自动重新平衡数据集，可以更好地学习人类的多任务演示，提升模仿学习的整体效果。

Abstract: Robots should be able to learn complex behaviors from human demonstrations.
In practice, these human-provided datasets are inevitably imbalanced: i.e., the
human demonstrates some subtasks more frequently than others. State-of-the-art
methods default to treating each element of the human's dataset as equally
important. So if -- for instance -- the majority of the human's data focuses on
reaching a goal, and only a few state-action pairs move to avoid an obstacle,
the learning algorithm will place greater emphasis on goal reaching. More
generally, misalignment between the relative amounts of data and the importance
of that data causes fundamental problems for imitation learning approaches. In
this paper we analyze and develop learning methods that automatically account
for mixed datasets. We formally prove that imbalanced data leads to imbalanced
policies when each state-action pair is weighted equally; these policies
emulate the most represented behaviors, and not the human's complex, multi-task
demonstrations. We next explore algorithms that rebalance offline datasets
(i.e., reweight the importance of different state-action pairs) without human
oversight. Reweighting the dataset can enhance the overall policy performance.
However, there is no free lunch: each method for autonomously rebalancing
brings its own pros and cons. We formulate these advantages and disadvantages,
helping other researchers identify when each type of approach is most
appropriate. We conclude by introducing a novel meta-gradient rebalancing
algorithm that addresses the primary limitations behind existing approaches.
Our experiments show that dataset rebalancing leads to better downstream
learning, improving the performance of general imitation learning algorithms
without requiring additional data collection. See our project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外参标定方法依赖结构化目标或完全激励数据，限制了实际应用；在线标定因弱激励导致估计不可靠。

Result: 在无人机、无人车和手持平台上实验表明，该方法优于传统优化方法，在弱激励条件下仍能实现高精度标定。

Conclusion: 该框架简化了多样化机器人平台的部署，支持从常规操作数据中完成标定。

Abstract: Extrinsic calibration is essential for multi-sensor fusion, existing methods
rely on structured targets or fully-excited data, limiting real-world
applicability. Online calibration further suffers from weak excitation, leading
to unreliable estimates. To address these limitations, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based extrinsic calibration framework that
formulates extrinsic calibration as a decision-making problem, directly
optimizes $SE(3)$ extrinsics to enhance odometry accuracy. Our approach
leverages a probabilistic Bingham distribution to model 3D rotations, ensuring
stable optimization while inherently retaining quaternion symmetry. A
trajectory alignment reward mechanism enables robust calibration without
structured targets by quantitatively evaluating estimated tightly-coupled
trajectory against a reference trajectory. Additionally, an automated data
selection module filters uninformative samples, significantly improving
efficiency and scalability for large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on
UAVs, UGVs, and handheld platforms demonstrate that our method outperforms
traditional optimization-based approaches, achieving high-precision calibration
even under weak excitation conditions. Our framework simplifies deployment on
diverse robotic platforms by eliminating the need for high-quality initial
extrinsics and enabling calibration from routine operating data. The code is

TL;DR: V*是一种基于图的运动规划器，通过在离散时空速度格中显式表示速度和方向状态变量，直接集成动态可行性，避免了传统方法的解耦或后处理平滑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在结构化环境中，自动驾驶车辆需要能够生成时间最优、无碰撞且满足动态和运动学约束的轨迹。传统方法往往将空间搜索与动态可行性解耦或依赖后处理平滑，存在局限性。

Method: V*采用六边形离散化策略，动态生成图，并通过几何剪枝策略消除不可行的转向配置。同时，建立了运动学自行车模型中瞬态转向动力学的数学公式。

Result: 仿真研究表明，V*能够在复杂动态环境中避免冲突、主动避让，并生成安全高效的轨迹，具备时间推理能力。

Conclusion: V*通过直接集成动态可行性，提供了一种高效且理论完备的运动规划方法，适用于自动驾驶车辆在结构化环境中的导航。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in structured environments requires planners
capable of generating time-optimal, collision-free trajectories that satisfy
dynamic and kinematic constraints. We introduce V*, a graph-based motion
planner that represents speed and direction as explicit state variables within
a discretised space-time-velocity lattice. Unlike traditional methods that
decouple spatial search from dynamic feasibility or rely on post-hoc smoothing,
V* integrates both motion dimensions directly into graph construction through
dynamic graph generation during search expansion. To manage the complexity of
high-dimensional search, we employ a hexagonal discretisation strategy and
provide formal mathematical proofs establishing optimal waypoint spacing and
minimal node redundancy under constrained heading transitions for
velocity-aware motion planning. We develop a mathematical formulation for
transient steering dynamics in the kinematic bicycle model, modelling steering
angle convergence with exponential behaviour, and deriving the relationship for
convergence rate parameters. This theoretical foundation, combined with
geometric pruning strategies that eliminate expansions leading to infeasible
steering configurations, enables V* to evaluate dynamically admissible
manoeuvres, ensuring each trajectory is physically realisable without further
refinement. We further demonstrate V*'s performance in simulation studies with
cluttered and dynamic environments involving moving obstacles, showing its
ability to avoid conflicts, yield proactively, and generate safe, efficient
trajectories with temporal reasoning capabilities for waiting behaviours and
dynamic coordination.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通用机器人策略在训练数据分布外泛化能力不足的原因，发现捷径学习是关键障碍，并提出数据集收集和增强策略以改善泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人策略在大规模数据集（如OXE）上表现良好，但在训练数据分布外泛化能力有限，研究旨在揭示其根本原因。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，识别捷径学习的两个主要来源：子数据集内多样性不足和子数据集间分布差异。

Result: 发现数据集结构和子数据集差异导致捷径学习，提出数据收集和增强策略以提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 优化数据集结构和采用数据增强策略可有效减少捷径学习，提升通用机器人策略的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open
X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks.
However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their
training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this
limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the
reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.
Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two
primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within
individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across
sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the
inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically
composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied
environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into
dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the
generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios
where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that
carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce
shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving
generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$, in
both simulation and real-world environments. More information at
