The resulting findings are the\nfollowing: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned\nand classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can\nyield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC,\nbut we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than\npreviously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric\ncontrol achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better\ntransient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or\nless agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required.\nFinally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for\nthese aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.\nWebsite and code is available at https://pratikkunapuli.github.io/rl-vs-gc/"}

Most prior work has relied on scripted or\nWizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time,\ninteractive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study\naddresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a\ncognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject\nexperiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or\npracticed independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary\n(memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by\nInteractive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the\nLbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those\nin the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with\nlower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural\nmetrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and\nengaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions:\n(1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable\nmodel for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the\nfeasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real\nclassrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing\nthat social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive\npartners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning\noutcomes."}

To address these challenges, we propose\nManipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model\nframework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation.\nMinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features,\nwhile leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction.\nThis architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with\ncoherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a\nvideo-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training\nstrategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically,\nwe introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their\nintermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model\nbetter understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also\nfunctions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in\nlatent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can\npreemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive\nexperiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves\nstate-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of\nunified world modeling in robotics."}
