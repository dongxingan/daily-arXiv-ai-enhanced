A recent study has shown how self-aggregation\nis possible in a multitask approach -- where multiple self-aggregation task\ninstances occur concurrently in the same environment. The multitask approach\nposes new challenges, in special, how the dynamic of each group impacts the\nperformance of others. So far, the multitask self-aggregation of groups of\nrobots suffers from generating a circular formation -- that is not fully\ncompact -- or is not fully autonomous. In this paper, we present a multitask\nself-aggregation where groups of homogeneous robots sort themselves into\ndifferent compact clusters, relying solely on a line-of-sight sensor. Our\nmultitask self-aggregation behavior was able to scale well and achieve a\ncompact formation. We report scalability results from a series of simulation\ntrials with different configurations in the number of groups and the number of\nrobots per group.
