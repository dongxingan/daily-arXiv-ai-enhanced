To bridge this gap, we introduce\nVLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and\nwheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several\nego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical\npipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action\nprediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,\nmap-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results\nreveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation\nspace, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like\ncollisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged\nrobots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless\nintegration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN\nevaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical\ndeployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's\noverall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to\nrethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models.

An interdisciplinary dialogue between Social Sciences and Social Robotics", "comment": null, "summary": "As robots find their way into more and more aspects of everyday life,\nquestions around trust are becoming increasingly important. What does it mean\nto trust a robot? And how should we think about trust in relationships that\ninvolve both humans and non-human agents? While the field of Human-Robot\nInteraction (HRI) has made trust a central topic, the concept is often\napproached in fragmented ways. At the same time, established work in sociology,\nwhere trust has long been a key theme, is rarely brought into conversation with\ndevelopments in robotics. This article argues that we need a more\ninterdisciplinary approach. By drawing on insights from both social sciences\nand social robotics, we explore how trust is shaped, tested and made visible.\nOur goal is to open up a dialogue between disciplines and help build a more\ngrounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in the evolving world\nof human-robot interaction."}

Coates"], "title": "Efficient Online Learning and Adaptive Planning for Robotic Information Gathering Based on Streaming Data", "comment": null, "summary": "Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile\nrobots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of\nsensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to\nfind sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of\ninformation collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming\nthat the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be\nunknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active\narea of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required\nfor mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP)\nregression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial\nfields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time\nperformance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for\nmapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation\nexperiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against\nexisting benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to\nfurther validate the efficacy of the proposed method.

This not only affects the control performance, but\nalso increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the\ndesired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates\na long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent\ncost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative\nmethods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,\nin particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)\nmaintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)\nensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to\nenvironments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages\nthe concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients\nof the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed\nmethod in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC\nconsistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times\nclose to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the\nshort-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In\nparticular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during\ntraining."}

To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a\nnew simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps.

To address this limitation,\nrein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising\nstrategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation\nsignals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback\nmechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the\nnatural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the\nuser. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback\n(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)\nsignals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,\nimplicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed\nmethod adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into\nprobabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in\nthe presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a\nsimulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2\nrobotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding\nobstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents\ntrained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those\ntrained with dense, manually designed rewards.

Despite human expertise in tool manipulation, teaching robots these\nskills faces challenges. The complexity arises from the interplay of two\nsimultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another\nbetween the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a\ncrucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool\nmanipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world\ndata and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot\ntool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework\ninvolves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in\ntool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations\ncollected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate\nthat this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with\ndiverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations\non the Franka Emika robot arm. Our analysis suggests that the robot acquires\nnew tool-use skills by transferring the ability to recognise tool-environment\ncontact relationships from pre-trained to fine-tuned policies. Additionally,\ncombining proximity and tactile sensors enhances the identification of contact\nstates and environmental geometry."}

Our approach leverages two key insights.

Second, we develop a method, Latent\nPolicy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by\nsearching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real\nworld experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of\npolicies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement\nwith 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50\ndemonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand\nepisodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different\nrobots or a cost-effective human dataset from play."}
