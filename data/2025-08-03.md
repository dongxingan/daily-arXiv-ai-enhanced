### [1] [Learning to Prune Branches in Modern Tree-Fruit Orchards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23015)
*Abhinav Jain,Cindy Grimm,Stefan Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的闭环控制机器人修剪系统，用于高效修剪果树，无需完整3D重建，仅需光学流图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代高产量果园的休眠修剪劳动密集且必要，需要自动化解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了无需复杂3D重建的可行性，但性能仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern
highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop
visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter
through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures
the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a
novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches
in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring
full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a
wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the
real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer,
achieving a 30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle
planner.

### [2] [A Certifably Correct Algorithm for Generalized Robot-World and Hand-Eye Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23045)
*Emmett Wise,Pushyami Kaveti,Qilong Chen,Wenhao Wang,Hanumant Singh,Jonathan Kelly,David M. Rosen,Matthew Giamou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速且全局最优的算法，用于解决广义的机器人世界和手眼标定（RWHEC）问题，支持多传感器和目标姿态的同时估计，并适用于单目相机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 展示了该方法优于现有解决方案的性能，并提供了开源实现。

Conclusion: 该方法在标定问题上表现出色，具有高效性和通用性，适用于复杂传感器配置。

Abstract: Automatic extrinsic sensor calibration is a fundamental problem for
multi-sensor platforms. Reliable and general-purpose solutions should be
computationally efficient, require few assumptions about the structure of the
sensing environment, and demand little effort from human operators. Since the
engineering effort required to obtain accurate calibration parameters increases
with the number of sensors deployed, robotics researchers have pursued methods
requiring few assumptions about the sensing environment and minimal effort from
human operators. In this work, we introduce a fast and certifiably globally
optimal algorithm for solving a generalized formulation of the
$\textit{robot-world and hand-eye calibration}$ (RWHEC) problem. The
formulation of RWHEC presented is "generalized" in that it supports the
simultaneous estimation of multiple sensor and target poses, and permits the
use of monocular cameras that, alone, are unable to measure the scale of their
environments. In addition to demonstrating our method's superior performance
over existing solutions, we derive novel identifiability criteria and establish
$\textit{a priori}$ guarantees of global optimality for problem instances with
bounded measurement errors. We also introduce a complementary Lie-algebraic
local solver for RWHEC and compare its performance with our global method and
prior art. Finally, we provide a free and open-source implementation of our
algorithms and experiments.

### [3] [In-between Motion Generation Based Multi-Style Quadruped Robot Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23053)
*Yuanhao Chen,Liu Zhao,Ji Ma,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于中间运动生成的多风格四足机器人运动框架，结合运动生成和模仿学习，解决了参考运动数据多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四足机器人因参考运动数据多样性有限，难以实现多样化运动。

Result: 提高了速度跟踪性能和控制器稳定性，成功在真实机器人上验证了多种复杂运动。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效生成和执行复杂运动，显著提升机器人性能。

Abstract: Quadruped robots face persistent challenges in achieving versatile locomotion
due to limitations in reference motion data diversity. To address these
challenges, this approach introduces an in-between motion generation based
multi-style quadruped robot locomotion framework, integrating synergistic
advances in motion generation and imitation learning. Our approach establishes
a unified pipeline addressing two fundamental aspects: First, we propose a CVAE
based motion generator, synthesizing multi-style dynamically feasible
locomotion sequences between arbitrary start and end states. By embedding
physical constraints and leveraging joint poses based phase manifold
continuity, this component produces physically plausible motions spanning
multiple gait modalities while ensuring kinematic compatibility with robotic
morphologies. Second, we adopt the adversarial motion priors algorithm. We
validate the effectiveness of generated motion data in enhancing controller
stability and improving velocity tracking performance. The proposed framework
demonstrates significant improvements in velocity tracking and deployment
stability. We successfully deploy the framework on a real-world quadruped
robot, and the experimental validation confirms the framework's capability to
generate and execute complex motion profiles, including gallop, tripod,
trotting and pacing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI驱动的手术辅助解决方案缺乏灵活性，限制了动态手术环境中的人机交互。

Conclusion: 该感知代理通过提供自然的人机交互和克服刚性，使AI在动态手术环境中的实时辅助更接近现实。

Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those
designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine
interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive
aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited
flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic
surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific
pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work
introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM),
and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine
interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a
memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements,
Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen
elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the
ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes
a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through
quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our
agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting
strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting
novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated
dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity,
our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in
dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.

### [5] [Simulation-based planning of Motion Sequences for Automated Procedure Optimization in Multi-Robot Assembly Cells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23270)
*Loris Schneider,Marc Ungen,Elias Huber,Jan-Felix Klein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种基于仿真的方法，用于优化多机器人装配单元的配置和运动序列，以减少装配时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可重构多机器人单元能应对波动的装配需求，但其配置的反复规划带来了新挑战，尤其是生成优化的、协调的多机器人运动序列。

Conclusion: 通过仿真实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够显著提升多机器人装配效率。

Abstract: Reconfigurable multi-robot cells offer a promising approach to meet
fluctuating assembly demands. However, the recurrent planning of their
configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in generating optimized,
coordinated multi-robot motion sequences that minimize the assembly duration.
This work presents a simulation-based method for generating such optimized
sequences. The approach separates assembly steps into task-related core
operations and connecting traverse operations. While core operations are
constrained and predetermined, traverse operations offer substantial
optimization potential. Scheduling the core operations is formulated as an
optimization problem, requiring feasible traverse operations to be integrated
using a decomposition-based motion planning strategy. Several solution
techniques are explored, including a sampling heuristic, tree-based search and
gradient-free optimization. For motion planning, a decomposition method is
proposed that identifies specific areas in the schedule, which can be solved
independently with modified centralized path planning algorithms. The proposed
method generates efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures
that outperform a baseline relying on decentralized, robot-individual motion
planning. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation experiments.

### [6] [Benchmarking Massively Parallelized Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning for Robotics Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23172)
*Vira Joshi,Zifan Xu,Bo Liu,Peter Stone,Amy Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MTBench是一个用于多任务强化学习（MTRL）的大规模并行基准测试，包含70个任务，支持GPU加速模拟，并评估了多种算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MTRL研究主要局限于低并行化的离线策略方法，而在线策略算法在大规模并行化下可能表现更好。

Method: 开发了MTBench基准测试，包含50个操作任务和20个运动任务，使用IsaacGym模拟器，并评估了四种基础RL算法和七种MTRL算法。

Result: 实验表明MTBench能快速评估MTRL方法，并揭示了大规模并行化与MTRL结合的新挑战。

Conclusion: MTBench为MTRL研究提供了统一框架，展示了大规模并行化的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Multi-task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) has emerged as a critical training
paradigm for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to a set of complex
real-world robotic tasks, which demands a generalizable and robust policy. At
the same time, \emph{massively parallelized training} has gained popularity,
not only for significantly accelerating data collection through GPU-accelerated
simulation but also for enabling diverse data collection across multiple tasks
by simulating heterogeneous scenes in parallel. However, existing MTRL research
has largely been limited to off-policy methods like SAC in the
low-parallelization regime. MTRL could capitalize on the higher asymptotic
performance of on-policy algorithms, whose batches require data from the
current policy, and as a result, take advantage of massive parallelization
offered by GPU-accelerated simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
massively parallelized $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{T}$ask $\textbf{Bench}$mark
for robotics (MTBench), an open-sourced benchmark featuring a broad
distribution of 50 manipulation tasks and 20 locomotion tasks, implemented
using the GPU-accelerated simulator IsaacGym. MTBench also includes four base
RL algorithms combined with seven state-of-the-art MTRL algorithms and
architectures, providing a unified framework for evaluating their performance.
Our extensive experiments highlight the superior speed of evaluating MTRL
approaches using MTBench, while also uncovering unique challenges that arise
from combining massive parallelism with MTRL. Code is available at

### [7] [Learning to Drift with Individual Wheel Drive: Maneuvering Autonomous Vehicle at the Handling Limits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23339)

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂环境中实现了仿真与现实的平滑过渡。

Abstract: Drifting, characterized by controlled vehicle motion at high sideslip angles,
is crucial for safely handling emergency scenarios at the friction limits.
While recent reinforcement learning approaches show promise for drifting
control, they struggle with the significant simulation-to-reality gap, as
policies that perform well in simulation often fail when transferred to
physical systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework
with GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and systematic domain randomization
that effectively bridges the gap. The proposed approach is validated on both
simulation and a custom-designed and open-sourced 1/10 scale Individual Wheel
Drive (IWD) RC car platform featuring independent wheel speed control.
Experiments across various scenarios from steady-state circular drifting to
direction transitions and variable-curvature path following demonstrate that
our approach achieves precise trajectory tracking while maintaining controlled
sideslip angles throughout complex maneuvers in both simulated and real-world
environments.

### [8] [Quadratic Programming-Based Posture Manipulation and Thrust-vectoring for Agile Dynamic Walking on Narrow Pathways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23203)

Result: 模拟实验表明，推进器辅助可显著提高机器人在狭窄路径行走和侧向推力恢复中的稳定性。

Conclusion: 推进器辅助是提升腿式机器人动态稳定性的有效方法，尤其在复杂环境中。

Abstract: There has been significant advancement in legged robot's agility where they
can show impressive acrobatic maneuvers, such as parkour. These maneuvers rely
heavily on posture manipulation. To expand the stability and locomotion
plasticity, we use the multi-modal ability in our legged-aerial platform, the
Husky Beta, to perform thruster-assisted walking. This robot has thrusters on
each of its sagittal knee joints which can be used to stabilize its frontal
dynamic as it walks. In this work, we perform a simulation study of quadruped
narrow-path walking with Husky $\beta$, where the robot will utilize its
thrusters to stably walk on a narrow path. The controller is designed based on
a centroidal dynamics model with thruster and foot ground contact forces as
inputs. These inputs are regulated using a QP solver to be used in a model
predictive control framework. In addition to narrow-path walking, we also
perform a lateral push-recovery simulation to study how the thrusters can be
used to stabilize the frontal dynamics.

### [9] [Multi-Waypoint Path Planning and Motion Control for Non-holonomic Mobile Robots in Agricultural Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23350)
*Mahmoud Ghorab,Matthias Lorenzen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合DTSP和NMPC的导航框架，用于农业环境中自主移动机器人的高效路径规划和控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足农业环境中自主移动机器人导航的需求，如杂草控制，需高效路径规划并减少土壤和植被损害。

Method: 结合DTSP全局路径规划和NMPC局部控制策略，生成最短且曲率受限的路径，并通过NMPC精确控制。

Result: 仿真验证显示，该方法路径更平滑、更短（减少约16%），且NMPC能有效引导机器人到达目标点。

Conclusion: 该框架在农业环境中具有高效自主导航的潜力。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating
unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows
require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while
minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent
soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated
navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins
Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a
minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets,
while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately
reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative
simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the
coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a
reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods.
Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired
waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to
constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework
for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.

### [10] [Quantifying and Visualizing Sim-to-Real Gaps: Physics-Guided Regularization for Reproducibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23445)
*Yuta Kawachi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于PID增益正则化和参数条件化的方法，用于缩小机器人控制中的仿真到现实的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于低齿轮比、可反向驱动的执行器的仿真到现实转移方法在差距较大时失效，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 通过重新解释PID增益作为未建模动态的替代，引入物理引导的增益正则化方案，并结合参数条件化的RNN控制器。

Result: 在硬件实验中，该方法实现了与仿真接近的角稳定时间，而纯域随机化策略则表现出持续振荡和较大差距。

Conclusion: 该方法为经济型机器人硬件提供了一种轻量级、可重复的缩小仿真到现实差距的框架。

Abstract: Simulation-to-real transfer using domain randomization for robot control
often relies on low-gear-ratio, backdrivable actuators, but these approaches
break down when the sim-to-real gap widens. Inspired by the traditional PID
controller, we reinterpret its gains as surrogates for complex, unmodeled plant
dynamics. We then introduce a physics-guided gain regularization scheme that
measures a robot's effective proportional gains via simple real-world
experiments. Then, we penalize any deviation of a neural controller's local
input-output sensitivities from these values during training. To avoid the
overly conservative bias of naive domain randomization, we also condition the
controller on the current plant parameters. On an off-the-shelf two-wheeled
balancing robot with a 110:1 gearbox, our gain-regularized,
parameter-conditioned RNN achieves angular settling times in hardware that
closely match simulation. At the same time, a purely domain-randomized policy
exhibits persistent oscillations and a substantial sim-to-real gap. These
results demonstrate a lightweight, reproducible framework for closing
sim-to-real gaps on affordable robotic hardware.

### [11] [GSFusion:Globally Optimized LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Mapping for Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23273)
*Jaeseok Park,Chanoh Park,Minsu Kim,Soohwan Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GSFusion是一种结合LiDAR、惯性和视觉的在线映射系统，通过全局位姿图优化和高效高斯初始化策略，解决了3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在稀疏数据和长优化时间上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于相机传感器的3DGS方法存在计算负载高、在纹理或光照差的环境中失效以及操作范围短等问题，而LiDAR的引入带来了新的挑战，如全局对齐需求和高优化时间。

Method: GSFusion采用全局位姿图优化中的surfel-to-surfel约束确保地图一致性，并通过像素感知的高斯初始化和有界Sigmoid约束处理稀疏数据。

Result: 实验表明，GSFusion在渲染质量和地图构建效率上优于现有3DGS SLAM系统。

Conclusion: GSFusion通过多传感器融合和优化策略，显著提升了3DGS在复杂环境中的性能和效率。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping,
conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from
fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in
environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges.
LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces
new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for
photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data.
To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online
LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map
consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph
optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian
initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid
constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and
our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in
terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

### [12] [Human-Exoskeleton Kinematic Calibration to Improve Hand Tracking for Dexterous Teleoperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23592)

Conclusion: 该框架适用于具有闭环运动学和最小传感的外骨骼设计，为高保真远程操作和示范学习应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and
immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains
a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning
inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade
tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a
subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that
uses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to
estimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our
method improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with
varying hand geometries. We introduce a data-driven approach to empirically
tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling more
accurate and consistent calibration across participants. Quantitative results
from seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking
errors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative
visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in
motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes across exoskeleton designs
with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, and lays the foundation for
high-fidelity teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications.

Result: 算法能有效跟踪物体并实现亚毫米级精度的轮廓重建。

Conclusion: 通过仿真和实验验证了方法的有效性，触须传感器能成功跟踪不同物体表面。

Abstract: Perception using whisker-inspired tactile sensors currently faces a major
challenge: the lack of active control in robots based on direct contact
information from the whisker. To accurately reconstruct object contours, it is
crucial for the whisker sensor to continuously follow and maintain an
appropriate relative touch pose on the surface. This is especially important
for localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp
surfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we
first construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact
and robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms. We develop
a method that leverages a characterized whisker deflection profile to directly
extract the tip contact position using gradient descent, with a Bayesian filter
applied to reduce fluctuations. We then propose an active motion control policy
to maintain the optimal relative pose of the whisker sensor against the object
surface. A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature
and determine the sensor orientation. Results demonstrate that our algorithm
can effectively track objects and reconstruct contours with sub-millimeter
accuracy. Finally, we validate the method in simulations and real-world
experiments where a robot arm drives the whisker sensor to follow the surfaces
of three different objects.

Abstract: A key challenge in deploying automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring they make
appropriate decisions in ethically challenging everyday driving situations.
While much attention has been paid to rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as
trolley problems, similar tensions also arise in routine scenarios, such as
navigating empty intersections, where multiple human considerations, including
legality and comfort, often conflict. Current AV planning systems typically
rely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations
and can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper
proposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that
operationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The
framework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as
quantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align
with these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and
integrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the
framework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a
real-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals
tensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort.
The framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning
algorithms. It offers a transparent tool for assessing ethical alignment in
everyday scenarios and provides a practical step toward implementing MHC in
real-world AV deployment.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving
human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex,
open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,
limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction
from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified
Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion
(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered
reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with
high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural
language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable
context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior
performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.
The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks
for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous
driving systems.

*Ryo Miyoshi,Yuki Okafuji,Takuya Iwamoto,Junya Nakanishi,Jun Baba*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态社交信号（面部表情和声音）的Transformer模型，用于估计人机交互中的用户体验（UX），并通过多实例学习框架捕捉短期和长期交互模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会机器人需要根据用户状态调整行为，而现有方法通常单独评估用户体验的多方面（如情感和参与度），缺乏全面性。

Method: 构建UX数据集，开发基于Transformer的模型，利用面部表情和声音信号，结合多实例学习框架捕捉交互的时空动态。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在UX估计上优于第三方人类评估者。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态信号和时空动态捕捉，提供了更全面的UX评估，优于传统方法。

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to
adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user
experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this
adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as
sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these
individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging
multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a
Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for
estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our
approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a
multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal
dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX
estimation.

*Kai Goebel,Patrik Zips*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文评估了大语言模型在机器人任务规划中的表现，发现其在简单任务中表现良好，但在复杂场景中仍存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在生成结构化、可执行机器人任务规划中的有效性。

Method: 通过直接提示语言模型使用Planning Domain Definition Language文件，并与Fast Downward规划器在多种基准测试中比较性能。

Result: 模型在简单任务中表现良好，但在复杂场景（如资源管理、状态跟踪和约束遵守）中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 未来研究应结合语言模型与传统规划器，以提高机器人规划的可靠性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their
potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong
generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and
executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation
of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly
prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,
and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a
variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how
faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can
actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these
models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on
simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios
that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict
constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in
applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By
outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future
research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with
classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of
planning in autonomous robotics.

Method: 提出对象图表示和匹配方法，并引入增量GCM（Group-wise Consistent Measurement Set Maximization）优化扫描匹配。

Result: 在仿真和真实数据集上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: DRACo-SLAM2通过对象图和增量GCM显著提升了水下多机器人SLAM的性能和效率。

Abstract: We present DRACo-SLAM2, a distributed SLAM framework for underwater robot
teams equipped with multibeam imaging sonar. This framework improves upon the
original DRACo-SLAM by introducing a novel representation of sonar maps as
object graphs and utilizing object graph matching to achieve time-efficient
inter-robot loop closure detection without relying on prior geometric
information. To better-accommodate the needs and characteristics of underwater
scan matching, we propose incremental Group-wise Consistent Measurement Set
Maximization (GCM), a modification of Pairwise Consistent Measurement Set
Maximization (PCM), which effectively handles scenarios where nearby
inter-robot loop closures share similar registration errors. The proposed
approach is validated through extensive comparative analyses on simulated and
real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DuLoc在动态和大规模室外环境中表现出卓越的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based localization serves as a critical component in autonomous
systems, yet existing approaches face persistent challenges in balancing
repeatability, accuracy, and environmental adaptability. Traditional point
cloud registration methods relying solely on offline maps often exhibit limited
robustness against long-term environmental changes, leading to localization
drift and reliability degradation in dynamic real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes DuLoc, a robust and accurate localization
method that tightly couples LiDAR-inertial odometry with offline map-based
localization, incorporating a constant-velocity motion model to mitigate
outlier noise in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we develop a LiDAR-based
localization framework that seamlessly integrates a prior global map with
dynamic real-time local maps, enabling robust localization in unbounded and
changing environments. Extensive real-world experiments in ultra unbounded port
that involve 2,856 hours of operational data across 32 Intelligent Guided
Vehicles (IGVs) are conducted and reported in this study. The results attained
demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art LiDAR
localization systems in large-scale changing outdoor environments.

Conclusion: BGS-SLAM填补了户外3DGS-SLAM的空白，展示了无需主动传感器的高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity in SLAM
applications due to its fast rendering and high-fidelity representation.
However, existing 3DGS-SLAM systems have predominantly focused on indoor
environments and relied on active depth sensors, leaving a gap for large-scale
outdoor applications. We present BGS-SLAM, the first binocular 3D Gaussian
Splatting SLAM system designed for outdoor scenarios. Our approach uses only
RGB stereo pairs without requiring LiDAR or active sensors. BGS-SLAM leverages
depth estimates from pre-trained deep stereo networks to guide 3D Gaussian
optimization with a multi-loss strategy enhancing both geometric consistency
and visual quality. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that BGS-SLAM
achieves superior tracking accuracy and mapping performance compared to other
3DGS-based solutions in complex outdoor environments.

Result: 在SIMPLER、LIBERO等模拟环境及真实机器人实验中表现优异。

Conclusion: ViLLA框架为未来研究提供了坚实基础，具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for
learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and
generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the
incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change
between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X,
a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent
action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our
approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are
incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable
villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including
SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper
and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds
significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for
future research.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language
modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A
primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or
environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors
across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this
challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can
achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore
RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction
capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL
representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a
unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome
the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task
synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale
multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework
to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction
success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial
reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our
findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated
environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for
significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有触觉传感器在微型机器人应用中受限于尺寸、重量和功耗，无法满足需求。

Method: 设计了一种多段式柔性层压传感器，嵌入电容角度传感器，实现被动弯曲和精确角度测量。

Result: CITRAS在静态和动态弯曲中误差分别仅为0.79度和3.58度，并能准确预测距离、间隙宽度和区分纹理。

Conclusion: CITRAS为微型机器人提供了关键的触觉感知能力，有望提升其在复杂环境中的自主探索和避障能力。

Abstract: The American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) uses its soft antennae to
guide decision making by extracting rich tactile information from tens of
thousands of distributed mechanosensors. Although tactile sensors enable
robust, autonomous perception and navigation in natural systems, replicating
these capabilities in insect-scale robots remains challenging due to stringent
size, weight, and power constraints that limit existing sensor technologies. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CITRAS (Cockroach Inspired Tactile
Robotic Antenna Sensor), a bioinspired, multi-segmented, compliant laminate
sensor with embedded capacitive angle sensors. CITRAS is compact (73.7x15.6x2.1
mm), lightweight (491 mg), and low-power (32 mW), enabling seamless integration
with miniature robotic platforms. The segmented compliant structure passively
bends in response to environmental stimuli, achieving accurate hinge angle
measurements with maximum errors of just 0.79 degree (quasistatic bending) and
3.58 degree (dynamic bending). Experimental evaluations demonstrate CITRAS'
multifunctional tactile perception capabilities: predicting base-to-tip
distances with 7.75 % error, estimating environmental gap widths with 6.73 %
error, and distinguishing surface textures through differential sensor
response. The future integration of this bioinspired tactile antenna in
insect-scale robots addresses critical sensing gaps, promising enhanced
autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and environmental mapping in
complex, confined environments.

versatile cognitive robotics framework capable of generalising to a diverse
array of real-world applications.
