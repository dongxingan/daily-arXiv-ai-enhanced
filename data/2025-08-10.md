### [1] [On the causality between affective impact and coordinated human-robot reactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04834)
*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨机器人主动分享对事件的反应是否影响人类对其情感影响的感知，发现共享反应和特定延迟时间显著改变感知效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善机器人在社交环境中的功能，探索其情感表达对人类感知的影响。

Method: 设计两组实验：一组隔离机器人反应的情感表达，另一组测试不同反应延迟时间对物理互动的影响。

Result: 共享事件的机器人反应显著改变人类感知；物理互动中，接近人类的反应时间（约200ms）效果最佳。

Conclusion: 200ms延迟对小型非人形机器人最有效；100ms延迟则更易让人类感到对机器人有影响。

Abstract: In an effort to improve how robots function in social contexts, this paper
investigates if a robot that actively shares a reaction to an event with a
human alters how the human perceives the robot's affective impact. To verify
this, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the
reaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the
effects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical
encounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups
(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting
with the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using
increasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.
The results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived
affective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human
observer rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared
physical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most
appropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around
200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized
non-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time
around 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers
feel they made the biggest impact on the robot.

### [2] [INTENTION: Inferring Tendencies of Humanoid Robot Motion Through Interactive Intuition and Grounded VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04931)
*Jin Wang,Weijie Wang,Boyuan Deng,Heng Zhang,Rui Dai,Nikos Tsagarakis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出INTENTION框架，结合视觉语言模型和交互驱动记忆，赋予机器人直觉式交互和自主操作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人控制依赖精确模型和预定义动作，难以适应复杂场景和任务泛化，而人类通过直觉和物理理解高效决策。

Method: 整合视觉语言模型（VLMs）的场景推理与交互驱动记忆，引入Memory Graph记录任务交互场景，设计Intuitive Perceptor提取物理关系和功能。

Result: 机器人能在新场景中推断适当交互行为，无需重复指令。

Conclusion: INTENTION框架提升了机器人在多样化场景中的自主操作能力，模拟人类直觉决策。

Abstract: Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on
precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in
structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due
to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In
contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating
remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical
understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling
robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in
diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene
reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record
scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding
and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design
an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from
visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate
interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions.

### [3] [Optimal Planning for Multi-Robot Simultaneous Area and Line Coverage Using Hierarchical Cyclic Merging Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04981)
*Tianyuan Zheng,Jingang Yi,Kaiyan Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决多机器人双重覆盖问题的最优规划算法HCMR，通过层次循环合并调节和莫尔斯理论分析，显著提升了路径长度和任务时间效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人在已知环境中同时覆盖线性特征和区域时的路径规划问题，需兼顾服务（高成本）和探索（低成本）的双重功能。

Method: 采用层次循环合并调节（HCMR）算法，结合莫尔斯理论分析流形附着过程，通过循环合并搜索和边序列反向传播生成最优路径。

Result: HCMR算法显著优于现有方法，路径长度减少至少10.0%，任务时间平均减少16.9%，且确保无冲突操作。

Conclusion: HCMR算法在固定扫描方向下具有最优性，为多机器人双重覆盖问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The double coverage problem focuses on determining efficient, collision-free
routes for multiple robots to simultaneously cover linear features (e.g.,
surface cracks or road routes) and survey areas (e.g., parking lots or local
regions) in known environments. In these problems, each robot carries two
functional roles: service (linear feature footprint coverage) and exploration
(complete area coverage). Service has a smaller operational footprint but
incurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal
planning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic
merging regulation (HCMR). To reduce the complexity for optimal planning
solutions, we analyze the manifold attachment process during graph traversal
from a Morse theory perspective. We show that solutions satisfying minimum path
length and collision-free constraints must belong to a Morse-bounded
collection. To identify this collection, we introduce the HCMR algorithm. In
HCMR, cyclic merging search regulates traversal behavior, while edge sequence
back propagation converts these regulations into graph edge traversal
sequences. Incorporating balanced partitioning, the optimal sequence is
selected to generate routes for each robot. We prove the optimality of the HCMR
algorithm under a fixed sweep direction. The multi-robot simulation results
demonstrate that the HCMR algorithm significantly improves planned path length
by at least 10.0%, reduces task time by at least 16.9% in average, and ensures
conflict-free operation compared to other state-of-the-art planning methods.

### [4] [Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Autonomous Maze Navigation of Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04994)
*Wenjie Hu,Ye Zhou,Hann Woei Ho*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的层次化DDPG（HDDPG）算法，通过高层和低层策略解决迷宫导航中的稀疏奖励和探索效率问题，显著提升了成功率和平均奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DDPG在迷宫导航中因稀疏奖励、探索效率低和长时程规划困难而表现不佳，需改进。

Method: HDDPG采用分层策略：高层生成子目标，低层执行动作，结合离策略校正、自适应噪声和优化奖励函数。

Result: HDDPG在ROS和Gazebo实验中，成功率和平均奖励分别提升至少56.59%和519.03。

Conclusion: HDDPG有效解决了DDPG的局限性，显著提升了迷宫导航性能。

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to
traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze
navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and
long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and
average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG
(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The
high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate
subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The
low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates
primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal
assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with
off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical
experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to
improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is
employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including
gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve
robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical
simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and
Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze
navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard
DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and
boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline
algorithms.

### [5] [A General Control Method for Human-Robot Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14762)
*Maddalena Feder,Giorgio Grioli,Manuel G. Catalano,Antonio Bicchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的广义控制方法，用于多自由度设备，帮助运动能力受限的人完成日常活动。该方法通过低维空间映射用户动作到复杂机器人辅助设备，目标是减少用户努力和不适。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何有效控制多自由度辅助设备（如假肢、远程机器人化身）的挑战，实现人机一体化系统。

Method: 提出一个框架，将用户补偿动作转化为机器人命令，同时减少补偿，适用于从假肢到全身机器人化身的多种设备。

Result: 通过模拟场景和真实试验验证了该控制策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为多自由度辅助设备提供了一种通用控制解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new generalized control method designed for
multi-degrees-of-freedom devices to help people with limited motion
capabilities in their daily activities. The challenge lies in finding the most
adapted strategy for the control interface to effectively map user's motions in
a low-dimensional space to complex robotic assistive devices, such as
prostheses, supernumerary limbs, up to remote robotic avatars. The goal is a
system which integrates the human and the robotic parts into a unique system,
moving so as to reach the targets decided by the human while autonomously
reducing the user's effort and discomfort. We present a framework to control
general multi DoFs assistive systems, which translates user-performed
compensatory motions into the necessary robot commands for reaching targets
while canceling or reducing compensation. The framework extends to prostheses
of any number of DoF up to full robotic avatars, regarded here as a sort of
whole-body prosthesis of the person who sees the robot as an artificial
extension of their own body without a physical link but with a sensory-motor
integration. We have validated and applied this control strategy through tests
encompassing simulated scenarios and real-world trials involving a virtual twin
of the robotic parts (prosthesis and robot) and a physical humanoid avatar.

### [6] [MAG-Nav: Language-Driven Object Navigation Leveraging Memory-Reserved Active Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05021)
*Weifan Zhang,Tingguang Li,Yuzhen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的导航框架，通过主动视角调整和历史记忆回溯机制，显著提升了复杂未知环境中的视觉语言接地能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能机器人在未知环境中仅依赖自然语言描述进行视觉导航的挑战。

Method: 结合视角主动接地和历史记忆回溯机制，优化感知并利用记忆解决歧义。

Result: 在HM3D数据集上优于现有方法，并在四足机器人上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架在零样本条件下实现了对多样化语言描述的强泛化能力，且无需标注数据或微调。

Abstract: Visual navigation in unknown environments based solely on natural language
descriptions is a key capability for intelligent robots. In this work, we
propose a navigation framework built upon off-the-shelf Visual Language Models
(VLMs), enhanced with two human-inspired mechanisms: perspective-based active
grounding, which dynamically adjusts the robot's viewpoint for improved visual
inspection, and historical memory backtracking, which enables the system to
retain and re-evaluate uncertain observations over time. Unlike existing
approaches that passively rely on incidental visual inputs, our method actively
optimizes perception and leverages memory to resolve ambiguity, significantly
improving vision-language grounding in complex, unseen environments. Our
framework operates in a zero-shot manner, achieving strong generalization to
diverse and open-ended language descriptions without requiring labeled data or
model fine-tuning. Experimental results on Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in language-driven
object navigation. We further demonstrate its practicality through real-world
deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving robust and effective navigation
performance.

### [7] [A Multi-view Landmark Representation Approach with Application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05368)
*Tong Hua,Jiale Han,Wei Ouyang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视角仅姿态估计方法，应用于GNSS-视觉-惯性里程计（GVIO），通过直接关联地标表示与多相机姿态和观测，提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IEKF在联合优化相机姿态和地标时计算负担高，限制了其在多传感器融合中的效率和适用性。

Method: 推导了一种视觉测量模型，直接关联地标与多相机姿态和观测，形成紧密耦合的姿态仅测量，并应用于基于滤波的GVIO。

Result: 仿真和实际实验表明，该方法在效率和精度上均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了GVIO的计算效率和精度，适用于多传感器融合场景。

Abstract: Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in
vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational
burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its
efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view
pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial
Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual
measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with
multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven
to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null
space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed
approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both
simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机械臂系统的高维度和潜在碰撞问题使得传统运动规划方法难以生成平滑且高效的轨迹，而现有快捷方法的具体影响和性能描述模糊。

Method: 通过定量比较现有快捷方法，分析其优缺点，并提出两种组合策略。

Result: 研究提供了对不同快捷方法的全面分析，并展示了组合策略在性能与运行时间上的优势。

Conclusion: 论文提出的组合策略能够有效优化多机械臂系统的轨迹规划，平衡性能与运行时间。

Abstract: Generating high-quality motion plans for multiple robot arms is challenging
due to the high dimensionality of the system and the potential for inter-arm
collisions. Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions that are
suboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution time for multi-arm systems.
Post-processing via shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality
for efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm scenarios, optimizing
one arm's motion must not introduce collisions with other arms. Although
existing multi-arm planning works often use some form of shortcutting
techniques, their exact methodology and impact on performance are often vaguely
described. In this work, we present a comprehensive study quantitatively
comparing existing shortcutting methods for multi-arm trajectories across
diverse simulated scenarios. We carefully analyze the pros and cons of each
shortcutting method and propose two simple strategies for combining these
methods to achieve the best performance-runtime tradeoff. Video, code, and
dataset are available at https://philip-huang.github.io/mr-shortcut/.

### [9] [Towards Generalizable Safety in Crowd Navigation via Conformal Uncertainty Handling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05634)
*Jianpeng Yao,Xiaopan Zhang,Yu Xia,Zejin Wang,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury,Jiachen Li*

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动机器人在人群导航中面临分布偏移时性能下降，需要一种能适应不确定性的鲁棒导航策略。

Method: 通过自适应共形推理生成行人预测不确定性估计，并利用约束强化学习指导机器人行为。

Result: 在分布内场景中，成功率提升8.80%，碰撞减少3.72倍；在分布外场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实机器人实验中验证了其安全性和鲁棒性，适用于稀疏和密集人群交互。

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are
available on https://gen-safe-nav.github.io/.

Result: 实验证实系统能即时响应碰撞，并能精确检测碰撞方向和大小。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效提升动态抓取的稳定性和安全性。

Abstract: External collisions to robot actuators typically pose risks to grasping
circular objects. This work presents a vision-based sensing module capable of
detecting collisions to maintain stable grasping with a soft gripper system.
The system employs an eye-in-palm camera with a broad field of view to
simultaneously monitor the motion of fingers and the grasped object.
Furthermore, we have developed a collision-rich grasping strategy to ensure the
stability and security of the entire dynamic grasping process. A physical soft
gripper was manufactured and affixed to a collaborative robotic arm to evaluate
the performance of the collision detection mechanism. An experiment regarding
testing the response time of the mechanism confirmed the system has the
capability to react to the collision instantaneously. A dodging test was
conducted to demonstrate the gripper can detect the direction and scale of
external collisions precisely.

Motivation: 提升人机交互中机器人动作的可读性，使人类能更准确地预测机器人意图。

Method: 使用NICO人形机器人进行实验，观察不同线索（注视、指向等）下参与者对机器人手臂动作的预测。

Result: 实验支持多模态优势和视觉主导假说。

Conclusion: 机器人动作的可读性可通过多模态线索提升，视觉信息尤为重要。

Abstract: Human--robot interaction requires robots whose actions are legible, allowing
humans to interpret, predict, and feel safe around them. This study
investigates the legibility of humanoid robot arm movements in a pointing task,
aiming to understand how humans predict robot intentions from truncated
movements and bodily cues. We designed an experiment using the NICO humanoid
robot, where participants observed its arm movements towards targets on a
touchscreen. Robot cues varied across conditions: gaze, pointing, and pointing
with congruent or incongruent gaze. Arm trajectories were stopped at 60\% or
80\% of their full length, and participants predicted the final target. We
tested the multimodal superiority and ocular primacy hypotheses, both of which
were supported by the experiment.

Result: 远程与本地机器人操作在用户感知上无显著差异。

Conclusion: 远程机器人操作可能是传统本地控制的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Robot teleoperation (RTo) has emerged as a viable alternative to local
control, particularly when human intervention is still necessary. This research
aims to study the distance effect on user perception in RTo, exploring the
potential of teleoperated robots for older adult care. We propose an evaluation
of non-expert users' perception of long-distance RTo, examining how their
perception changes before and after interaction, as well as comparing it to
that of locally operated robots. We have designed a specific protocol
consisting of multiple questionnaires, along with a dedicated software
architecture using the Robotics Operating System (ROS) and Unity. The results
revealed no statistically significant differences between the local and remote
robot conditions, suggesting that robots may be a viable alternative to
traditional local control.

TL;DR: Chemist Eye是一个分布式安全监控系统，用于提升自动驾驶实验室（SDL）的安全性，通过视觉语言模型（VLM）实时监测危险并指导机器人行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶实验室中机器人使用易燃锂电池增加了火灾风险，同时需要确保个人防护装备（PPE）的合规性，因此需要一种高效的安全监控系统。

Method: 系统集成多站点的RGB、深度和红外摄像头，利用VLM进行决策，实时监测危险并指导机器人远离危险区域。

Result: 在真实SDL环境中测试，Chemist Eye对安全风险的识别和决策性能分别达到97%和95%。

Conclusion: Chemist Eye能有效提升SDL的安全性，适用于实时监控和应急响应。

Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories
(SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that
already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective
equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and
well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are
another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that
occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have
increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety
monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system
integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,
designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot
workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE
compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making
driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless
integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM
recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential
fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible
warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging
platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist
Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and
found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making
performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.

*Mohammed Daba,Jing Qiu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FCBV-Net通过预训练的几何特征提升机器人服装平滑任务的类别级泛化能力，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人服装操作中因高维度和类别内变化导致的泛化能力不足问题。

Method: 提出FCBV-Net，利用3D点云和预训练的几何特征，分离几何理解与动作价值学习。

Result: 在模拟实验中，FCBV-Net在未见服装上效率下降仅11.5%，最终覆盖率达89%。

Conclusion: 几何特征与动作价值学习的解耦显著提升了类别级泛化能力。

Abstract: Category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation, such as
bimanual smoothing, remains a significant hurdle due to high dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and intra-category variations. Current approaches often
struggle, either overfitting with concurrently learned visual features for a
specific instance or, despite category-level perceptual generalization, failing
to predict the value of synergistic bimanual actions. We propose the
Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net), operating on 3D point
clouds to specifically enhance category-level policy generalization for garment
smoothing. FCBV-Net conditions bimanual action value prediction on pre-trained,
frozen dense geometric features, ensuring robustness to intra-category garment
variations. Trainable downstream components then learn a task-specific policy
using these static features. In simulated GarmentLab experiments with the
CLOTH3D dataset, FCBV-Net demonstrated superior category-level generalization.
It exhibited only an 11.5% efficiency drop (Steps80) on unseen garments
compared to 96.2% for a 2D image-based baseline, and achieved 89% final
coverage, outperforming an 83% coverage from a 3D correspondence-based baseline
that uses identical per-point geometric features but a fixed primitive. These
results highlight that the decoupling of geometric understanding from bimanual
action value learning enables better category-level generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务感知视图规划（TAVP）框架，通过主动视图规划和任务特定表示学习，解决了现有视觉-语言-动作模型在多任务机器人操作中的3D感知和任务干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型依赖静态视角和共享视觉编码器，限制了3D感知并导致任务干扰，影响了鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: TAVP结合主动视图规划和任务特定表示学习，采用高效探索策略和混合专家（MoE）视觉编码器，以任务感知方式生成更完整的视觉表示。

Result: 在RLBench任务上的实验表明，TAVP在动作预测方面表现显著优于现有固定视角方法。

Conclusion: TAVP通过任务感知的视觉表示和主动视图规划，显著提升了多任务机器人操作的性能。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world
in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual
representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across
a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks
show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided

including costume, behaviour, and human interactions, all integral to the
installation. Our observational analysis revealed three key challenges in
child-robot interactions: 1) Initiating and maintaining engagement, 2) Lack of
robot expressivity and reciprocity, and 3) Unmet expectations. Our findings
show that children are naturally curious, and adept at interacting with a
robotic art performer. However, our observations emphasise the critical need to
optimise human-robot interaction (HRI) systems through careful consideration of
audience's capabilities, perceptions, and expectations, within the performative
arts context, to enable engaging and meaningful experiences, especially for
young audiences.

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and
human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or
large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of
robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards
agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring
GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents
are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such
agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language
instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and
diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving
nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS
packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a
taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative
analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's
literature.

TL;DR: GhostShell利用LLM实现实时行为编程，通过流式XML解析器和动态接口映射器，协调多机器人组件的串并行动作，实验表明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义行为序列或行为树，无法满足实时性和灵活性需求，GhostShell旨在通过LLM实现动态行为编程。

Method: 采用流式XML函数令牌解析器、动态函数接口映射器和多通道调度器，支持同步和异步函数调用。

Result: 在34个真实任务中，GhostShell的行为正确性达0.85，响应速度比原生API快66倍，且在长时多模态任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: GhostShell为实时行为编程提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present GhostShell, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enable streaming and concurrent behavioral programming for embodied
systems. In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action
sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act
on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from
the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic
function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates
intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls,
thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic
components as directed by the LLM. We evaluate GhostShell on our robot
prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world
interaction tasks and multiple LLMs. The results demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4
Sonnet and up to 66X faster response times compared to LLM native function
calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal
tasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法依赖低级别轨迹模仿，难以泛化到不同物体类型、空间布局和机械配置。

Result: 实验显示，场景图准确率超95%，子任务分割达93%，双臂机器人执行任务成功率高达90%。

Conclusion: GF-VLA框架在任务泛化和执行效率上表现优异，为机器人学习复杂技能提供了新思路。

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to
the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize
across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We
propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables
dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly
from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts
Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest
task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs
that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are
fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve
execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand
selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit
geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block
assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial
generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene
representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask
segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and
human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these
policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90
percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric
reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness
across diverse spatial and semantic variations.

TL;DR: Affecta-context框架通过物理上下文信息优化社交机器人行为，包括上下文表示和行为优先级学习，实验验证了其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为社交机器人提供一种基于物理上下文的行为适应框架，以优化人机交互体验。

Method: 框架分为上下文表示和行为优先级学习两部分，通过聚类物理上下文和交互学习优化行为。

Result: 在72次交互实验中，机器人成功学习并泛化行为优先级，适应新物理上下文。

Conclusion: Affecta-context框架能有效提升社交机器人在不同物理环境中的行为适应性。

Abstract: This paper presents Affecta-context, a general framework to facilitate
behavior adaptation for social robots. The framework uses information about the
physical context to guide its behaviors in human-robot interactions. It
consists of two parts: one that represents encountered contexts and one that
learns to prioritize between behaviors through human-robot interactions. As
physical contexts are encountered the framework clusters them by their measured
physical properties. In each context, the framework learns to prioritize
between behaviors to optimize the physical attributes of the robot's behavior
in line with its current environment and the preferences of the users it
interacts with. This paper illlustrates the abilities of the Affecta-context
framework by enabling a robot to autonomously learn the prioritization of
discrete behaviors. This was achieved by training across 72 interactions in two
different physical contexts with 6 different human test participants. The paper
demonstrates the trained Affecta-context framework by verifying the robot's
ability to generalize over the input and to match its behaviors to a previously
unvisited physical context.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人类与机器人高强度对抗场景中，机器人如何通过五种情感表达模式化解冲突。结果表明，所有模式均有效，但运动模式表现不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解机器人如何通过情感表达缓解人类对表现不佳机器人的敌意。

Method: 使用定制情感机器人在模拟冲突场景中测试105名参与者，评估五种表达模式的效果。

Result: 所有表达模式均能成功化解冲突，运动模式与其他模式有显著差异。参与者对各模式的情感解读相似。

Conclusion: 化解高强度对抗更需机器人具备社会情境意识和反应能力，而非特定表达模式。

Abstract: This paper investigates the specific scenario of high-intensity
confrontations between humans and robots, to understand how robots can defuse
the conflict. It focuses on the effectiveness of using five different affective
expression modalities as main drivers for defusing the conflict. The aim is to
discover any strengths or weaknesses in using each modality to mitigate the
hostility that people feel towards a poorly performing robot. The defusing of
the situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the
conflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a
custom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test
participants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can
successfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of
the confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement
modality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test
participants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the
robot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities. This indicates
that defusing a high-intensity interaction may not demand special attention to
the expression abilities of the robot, but rather require attention to the
abilities of being socially aware of the situation and reacting in accordance
with it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在机器人操作任务中表现优异，但推理时间长且需要连续执行动作块，限制了其在延迟敏感任务中的应用。

Method: 借鉴最优控制中的RTI方案，利用前一时间步的解作为后续迭代的初始猜测，并提出基于缩放的方法处理离散动作。

Result: 实验表明，该方法大幅降低推理时间，性能与完整步去噪的扩散策略相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为预训练的扩散模型提供了一种高效推理方案，尤其适用于资源密集型大模型。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic
manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an
extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk
before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their
applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle
time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy
structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,
which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a
method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging
solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent
iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference
and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such
as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces
runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy
redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained
diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We
also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful
for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive
simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with
comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step
denoising. Our project page with additional resources is available at:

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集上，碰撞率降低50%，闭环性能提升3分。

Conclusion: DistillDrive通过知识蒸馏和多样化实例模仿，显著提升了自动驾驶模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and
model are publicly available at https://github.com/YuruiAI/DistillDrive

Abstract: Natural organisms use distributed actuation via their musculoskeletal systems
to adapt their gait for traversing diverse terrains or to morph their bodies to
perform varied tasks. A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to
mimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to
develop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,
such systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the
ability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky
control systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for
designing and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing
distributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines
3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight
actuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We
developed LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby
achieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,
which in turn results in global deformation of the robot. Furthermore, to
capitalize on the extensive design space, we develop two computational tools:
one to optimize the robot's skeletal graph, enabling multiple target
deformations, and another to co-optimize the skeletal designs and control gaits
to achieve target locomotion. We validate our system by building several robots
that show complex shape morphing, varying control schemes, and adaptability to
their environment. Our system integrates advances in modular material building,
untethered and distributed control, and computational design to introduce a new
generation of robots that brings us closer to the capabilities of living
organisms.

Result: 发现手腕灵活性和手指外展/内收对操作能力更重要，三指设计是简单与灵巧的折衷方案。

Conclusion: 人类手部并非最优设计，非人形手或六指设计可能提供更高灵巧性。

Abstract: Human manipulation skills represent a pinnacle of their voluntary motor
functions, requiring the coordination of many degrees of freedom and processing
of high-dimensional sensor input to achieve such a high level of dexterity.
Thus, we set out to answer whether the human hand, with its associated
biomechanical properties, sensors, and control mechanisms, is an ideal that we
should strive for in robotics-do we really need anthropomorphic robotic hands?
  This survey can help practitioners to make the trade-off between hand
complexity and potential manipulation skills. We provide an overview of the
human hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic
hands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are
capable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement
for mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is
missing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity?
  Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for
robotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist
flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are important for manipulation
capabilities. On the contrary, increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or
degrees of freedom is often not necessary. Three fingers are a good compromise
between simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two
opposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase
dexterity, suggesting that the human hand may not be the optimum.

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中，MICoBot显著优于纯LLM基线和其他任务分配模型。

Conclusion: MICoBot能有效适应多样化人类伙伴，提升协作效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

Conclusion: CleanUpBench为日常场景中的具体智能体提供了可扩展的测试平台。

Abstract: Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning,
but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far
from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode
capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic
and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that
systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning
tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world
applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible
benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning
scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service
robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic
arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes
manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess
generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task
completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To
support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic
strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between
low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed
for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.
