Among these, quadruped robots with\nmanipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.\nHowever, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of\nintegrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic\narm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.\nTeleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high\nlevel of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load\non the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that\ndirectly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler\nand more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by\nleveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external\ncamera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist\nposition. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to\ncontrol the robot's arm in real-time.

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range\nof challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can\nalready noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional\nsupervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical\npoints in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes\nleads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches.

Neural simulators have\nemerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,\ncapable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world\ndata; however, existing neural simulators typically require\napplication-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or\nenvironments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.\nIn this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural\nsimulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We\npropose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models\nfor predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact\nconstraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers\nin an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant\nsimulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an\ninterchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We\nconduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and\naccurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and\nenvironment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural\nengine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from\nreal-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeRD是一种神经机器人动力学模型，能够替代传统分析模拟器中的低层动力学和接触求解器，实现稳定准确的机器人仿真，并具有良好的泛化能力和从真实数据微调的能力。", "motivation": "现代机器人具有高自由度和复杂机构，传统分析模拟器仿真困难。现有神经模拟器需要特定任务训练且无法泛化到新任务/环境，主要因为全局状态表示不足。", "method": "提出NeRD模型，采用机器人中心和空间不变的仿真状态表示，替代传统模拟器中的低层动力学和接触求解器，并集成到先进机器人模拟器中作为可互换后端求解器。", "result": "实验表明NeRD模拟器在数千仿真步骤中稳定准确；能跨任务和环境配置泛化；支持纯神经引擎策略学习；可从真实数据微调以缩小仿真与现实差距。", "conclusion": "NeRD为关节刚体机器人提供了通用化的神经模拟器解决方案，克服了现有方法的局限性，在准确性、稳定性和泛化能力方面表现出色。"}}
