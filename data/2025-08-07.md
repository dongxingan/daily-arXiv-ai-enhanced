*Vu Ngoc Son,Pham Van Cuong,Dao Thi My Linh,Le Tieu Nien*

Main category: cs.RO

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不确定和干扰条件下，滑模控制（SMC）的参数选择对系统性能和鲁棒性至关重要，但参数优化困难。

Method: 采用遗传算法（GA）自动寻找最优SMC参数，满足性能标准。

Result: 仿真结果表明，遗传算法优化的SMC比传统SMC和模糊SMC具有更好的跟踪能力和更小的抖动效应。

Conclusion: 遗传算法优化SMC参数是一种高效方法，显著提升了机器人操纵器的控制性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for optimizing the sliding mode control (SMC)
parameter for a robot manipulator applying a genetic algorithm (GA). The
objective of the SMC is to achieve precise and consistent tracking of the
trajectory of the robot manipulator under uncertain and disturbed conditions.
However, the system effectiveness and robustness depend on the choice of the
SMC parameters, which is a difficult and crucial task. To solve this problem, a
genetic algorithm is used to locate the optimal values of these parameters that
gratify the capability criteria. The proposed method is efficient compared with
the conventional SMC and Fuzzy-SMC. The simulation results show that the
genetic algorithm with SMC can achieve better tracking capability and reduce
the chattering effect.

### [2] [Reliable and Real-Time Highway Trajectory Planning via Hybrid Learning-Optimization Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04436)
*Yujia Lu,Chong Wei,Lu Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合轨迹规划框架，结合学习方法的适应性和优化方法的安全性保证，用于高速公路自动驾驶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速公路驾驶环境变化快且反应时间有限，碰撞风险高，需要可靠高效的轨迹规划。

Method: 采用双层架构：上层用图神经网络预测纵向速度，下层用混合整数二次规划优化路径，引入线性近似降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在复杂紧急场景中生成平滑无碰撞轨迹，成功率超97%，平均规划时间54毫秒。

Conclusion: 框架具备实时能力，能有效保证安全性和效率。

Abstract: Autonomous highway driving presents a high collision risk due to
fast-changing environments and limited reaction time, necessitating reliable
and efficient trajectory planning. This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory
planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods
with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The
framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph
neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like
longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization
formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary
contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a
linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce
computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping
constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning
horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly
smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios,
achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms,
thereby confirming real-time capability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经过程（NPs）的地形高程建模方法，结合贝叶斯不确定性估计和神经网络效率，显著提升了实时性和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如高斯过程和神经网络）无法同时满足实时性、准确性和不确定性量化的需求，限制了复杂越野环境中的导航规划与控制。

Method: 利用LiDAR和相机传感器的语义特征，结合局部球查询注意力机制，降低计算复杂度并提升插值和外推精度。

Result: 在越野数据集上表现优于基线方法，计算复杂度降低17%，同时保持了地形高程的精确估计和不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 神经过程为复杂越野环境中的地形建模提供了一种高效且表达力强的方法。

Abstract: Terrain elevation modeling for off-road navigation aims to accurately
estimate changes in terrain geometry in real-time and quantify the
corresponding uncertainties. Having precise estimations and uncertainties plays
a crucial role in planning and control algorithms to explore safe and reliable
maneuver strategies. However, existing approaches, such as Gaussian Processes
(GPs) and neural network-based methods, often fail to meet these needs. They
are either unable to perform in real-time due to high computational demands,
underestimating sharp geometry changes, or harming elevation accuracy when
learned with uncertainties. Recently, Neural Processes (NPs) have emerged as a
promising approach that integrates the Bayesian uncertainty estimation of GPs
with the efficiency and flexibility of neural networks. Inspired by NPs, we
propose an effective NP-based method that precisely estimates sharp elevation
changes and quantifies the corresponding predictive uncertainty without losing
elevation accuracy. Our method leverages semantic features from LiDAR and
camera sensors to improve interpolation and extrapolation accuracy in
unobserved regions. Also, we introduce a local ball-query attention mechanism
to effectively reduce the computational complexity of global attention by 17\%
while preserving crucial local and spatial information. We evaluate our method
on off-road datasets having interesting geometric features, collected from
trails, deserts, and hills. Our results demonstrate superior performance over
baselines and showcase the potential of neural processes for effective and
expressive terrain modeling in complex off-road environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CP-Gen是一种利用单条专家轨迹生成机器人演示数据的方法，支持新物体几何和姿态，训练出的策略在真实世界中零样本迁移且泛化性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模机器人演示数据收集成本高且耗时，需要一种高效生成多样化数据的方法。

Method: 将专家轨迹分解为自由空间运动和机器人技能，通过关键点轨迹约束实现几何感知数据生成，采样变换后优化机器人关节配置。

Result: 在16个仿真任务和4个真实任务中，CP-Gen训练的策略平均成功率达77%，优于基线方法的50%。

Conclusion: CP-Gen通过几何感知数据生成显著提升了机器人策略的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large-scale demonstration data has powered key breakthroughs in robot
manipulation, but collecting that data remains costly and time-consuming. We
present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a
single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel
object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train
closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and
generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior
work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert
demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those
works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as
keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must
track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To
generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for
each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its
associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint
configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the
transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to
the first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and
four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and
tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve
an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves
an average of 50%.

### [5] [SCOUT: An in-vivo Methane Sensing System for Real-time Monitoring of Enteric Emissions in Cattle with ex-vivo Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04056)
*Yuelin Deng,Hinayah Rojas de Oliveira,Richard M. Voyles,Upinder Kaur*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SCOUT系统是一种创新的体内甲烷监测技术，解决了传统环境采样方法的局限性，实现了高分辨率连续监测，为畜牧业的可持续发展提供了新工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确测量肠道甲烷排放是推动畜牧业可持续发展的关键瓶颈，现有方法存在数据保留率低、环境干扰和分辨率不足等问题。

Method: 开发了SCOUT系统，采用闭环气体循环设计，通过高分辨率连续监测瘤胃甲烷浓度，并与传统环境采样系统进行交叉验证。

Result: SCOUT数据保留率高达82%（传统方法仅17%），甲烷浓度测量范围更高（100-1000倍），并揭示了行为与排放的新关联。

Conclusion: SCOUT系统是一项突破性技术，为基因组选择和精准畜牧管理提供了可靠工具，同时为甲烷动态研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Accurate measurement of enteric methane emissions remains a critical
bottleneck for advancing livestock sustainability through genetic selection and
precision management. Existing ambient sampling approaches suffer from low data
retention rates, environmental interference, and limited temporal resolution.
We developed SCOUT (Smart Cannula-mounted Optical Unit for Trace-methane), the
first robust in-vivo sensing system enabling continuous, high-resolution
monitoring of ruminal methane concentrations through an innovative closed-loop
gas recirculation design. We conducted comprehensive validation with two
cannulated Simmental heifers under contrasting dietary treatments, with
cross-platform comparison against established ambient sniffer systems. SCOUT
achieved exceptional performance with 82% data retention compared to 17% for
conventional sniffer systems, while capturing methane concentrations 100-1000x
higher than ambient approaches. Cross-platform validation demonstrated strong
scale-dependent correlations, with optimal correlation strength (r = -0.564
$\pm$ 0.007) at biologically relevant 40-minute windows and 100% statistical
significance. High-frequency monitoring revealed novel behavior-emission
coupling, including rapid concentration changes (14.5 $\pm$ 11.3k ppm)
triggered by postural transitions within 15 minutes, insights previously
inaccessible through existing technologies. The SCOUT system represents a
transformative advancement, enabling accurate, continuous emission phenotyping
essential for genomic selection programs and sustainable precision livestock
management. This validation framework establishes new benchmarks for
agricultural sensor performance while generating unprecedented biological
insights into ruminal methane dynamics, contributing essential tools for
sustainable livestock production in climate-conscious agricultural systems.

### [6] [DRIVE: Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified Evaluation for Constraint-Aware Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04066)
*Longling Geng,Huangxing Li,Viktor Lado Naess,Mert Pilanci*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DRIVE框架通过动态规则推断和验证评估，从专家演示中建模人类驾驶约束，结合概率建模和优化规划，生成符合人类偏好的轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需遵守隐含且上下文相关的软约束，但现有方法难以明确建模这些约束。

Method: DRIVE使用指数族似然建模估计状态转移可行性，构建概率化行为规则，并通过凸优化规划生成轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，DRIVE在多个数据集上实现0.0%的约束违反率，轨迹更平滑且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: DRIVE框架高效、可解释且鲁棒，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Understanding and adhering to soft constraints is essential for safe and
socially compliant autonomous driving. However, such constraints are often
implicit, context-dependent, and difficult to specify explicitly. In this work,
we present DRIVE, a novel framework for Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified
Evaluation that models and evaluates human-like driving constraints from expert
demonstrations. DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to
estimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic
representation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts.
These learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex
optimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories
that are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human
preferences. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixed constraint forms or
purely reward-based modeling, DRIVE offers a unified framework that tightly
couples rule inference with trajectory-level decision-making. It supports both
data-driven constraint generalization and principled feasibility verification.
We validate DRIVE on large-scale naturalistic driving datasets, including inD,
highD, and RoundD, and benchmark it against representative inverse constraint
learning and planning baselines. Experimental results show that DRIVE achieves
0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger
generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Verified evaluations further
demonstrate the efficiency, explanability, and robustness of the framework for
real-world deployment.

optimization, our system enables rapid trajectory generation and dynamic
collision avoidance for pick-and-place tasks. We demonstrate this capability on
robots equipped with additional degrees of freedom, including a 7th-axis
gantry, and benchmark performance across various scenarios. The results show
significant improvements in planning speed and robustness, highlighting the
potential of GPU-based planning pipelines for scalable, adaptable deployment in
modern industrial workflows.

Result: 实验表明，使用光流增强的触觉图像训练的分类器，手势分类准确率提高了9%。

Conclusion: 通过增强触觉图像的动态信息，可以有效提升手势识别的准确性。

Abstract: Tactile gesture recognition systems play a crucial role in Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) by enabling intuitive communication between humans and
robots. The literature mainly addresses this problem by applying machine
learning techniques to classify sequences of tactile images encoding the
pressure distribution generated when executing the gestures. However, some
gestures can be hard to differentiate based on the information provided by
tactile images alone. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective way to
improve the accuracy of a gesture recognition classifier. Our approach focuses
solely on processing the tactile images used as input by the classifier. In
particular, we propose to explicitly highlight the dynamics of the contact in
the tactile image by computing the dense optical flow. This additional
information makes it easier to distinguish between gestures that produce
similar tactile images but exhibit different contact dynamics. We validate the
proposed approach in a tactile gesture recognition task, showing that a
classifier trained on tactile images augmented with optical flow information
achieved a 9% improvement in gesture classification accuracy compared to one
trained on standard tactile images.

Result: 机器人互动显著降低儿童心率（p<0.01），显示一致镇静效果。

Conclusion: 触觉陪伴机器人可增强放松技术的治疗效果。

Abstract: Children diagnosed with anxiety disorders are taught a range of strategies to
navigate situations of heightened anxiety. Techniques such as deep breathing
and repetition of mantras are commonly employed, as they are known to be
calming and reduce elevated heart rates. Although these strategies are often
effective, their successful application relies on prior training of the
children for successful use when faced with challenging situations. This paper
investigates a pocket-sized companion robot designed to offer a relaxation
technique requiring no prior training, with a focus on immediate impact on the
user's heart rate. The robot utilizes a tactile game to divert the user's
attention, thereby promoting relaxation. We conducted two studies with children
who were not diagnosed with anxiety: a 14-day pilot study with two children
(age 8) and a main study with 18 children (ages 7-8). Both studies employed a
within-subjects design and focused on measuring heart rate during tactile
interaction with the robot and during non-use. Interacting with the robot was
found to significantly lower the study participants' heart rate (p$<$0.01)
compared to the non-use condition, indicating a consistent calming effect
across all participants. These results suggest that tactile companion robots
have the potential to enhance the therapeutic value of relaxation techniques.

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物理机器人部署中因实际物理和控制器不确定性导致的运动规划模型误差问题。

Method: 在KEASL规划器中引入随机控制器行为的三种方法，并在真实和模拟环境中进行实验验证。

Result: 整合随机控制器行为后，轨迹更保守，碰撞概率降低，但与基线规划相比，规划成功率有所下降。

Conclusion: 随机控制器行为的整合能有效减少碰撞风险，但需权衡规划成功率。

Abstract: Mobile robot motion planners rely on theoretical models to predict how the
robot will move through the world. However, when deployed on a physical robot,
these models are subject to errors due to real-world physics and uncertainty in
how the lower-level controller follows the planned trajectory. In this work, we
address this problem by presenting three methods of incorporating stochastic
controller behavior into the recombinant search space of the Kinodynamic
Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (KEASL) planner. To demonstrate this work,
we analyze the results of experiments performed on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog
Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in an off-road, unstructured environment using
two different perception algorithms, and performed an ablation study using a
full spectrum of simulated environment map complexities. Analysis of the data
found that incorporating stochastic controller sampling into KEASL leads to
more conservative trajectories that decrease predicted collision likelihood
when compared to KEASL without sampling. When compared to baseline planning
with expanded obstacle footprints, the predicted likelihood of collisions
becomes more comparable, but reduces the planning success rate for baseline
search.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于行为熵的多机器人自适应路径规划框架（BAPP），用于高风险环境中的自主危险地图绘制，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高风险、通信受限环境中多机器人探索与地图绘制的挑战，减少机器人因环境威胁或硬件限制导致的失败风险。

Method: 引入行为熵（BE）概念，提出BAPP框架，包含两种算法：BAPP-TID（智能触发高保真机器人）和BAPP-SIG（高风险下安全部署）。

Result: BAPP框架在单机器人和多机器人模拟中表现优异，BAPP-TID加速熵减，BAPP-SIG提高机器人存活率且信息损失最小。

Conclusion: 行为自适应规划在复杂、高风险环境中具有显著优势，BAPP框架通过空间分区和角色异构实现高效扩展。

Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in
high-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as
post-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these
missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of
failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a
behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot
teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes
Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations.
Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning
(BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a
tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms:
BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for
safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the
informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness
through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that
the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies:
BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot
survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent
deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base
relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value
of behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in
complex, failure-prone environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$NavA^3$的分层框架，用于解决复杂开放场景中的长时程导航任务，结合全局和局部策略，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航任务局限于预定义对象或指令跟随，无法满足真实场景中复杂开放需求，需开发能理解高级指令和开放词汇定位的方法。

Method: 采用分层框架：全局策略利用Reasoning-VLM解析指令并整合3D场景视图；局部策略通过NaviAfford模型（基于1.0百万样本数据集）实现开放词汇对象定位。

Result: $NavA^3$在导航性能上达到SOTA，能成功完成不同机器人平台的长时程导航任务。

Conclusion: $NavA^3$为通用导航提供了可行方案，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability of embodied intelligence,
enabling robots to move and interact within physical environments. However,
existing navigation tasks primarily focus on predefined object navigation or
instruction following, which significantly differs from human needs in
real-world scenarios involving complex, open-ended scenes. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a challenging long-horizon navigation task that requires
understanding high-level human instructions and performing spatial-aware object
navigation in real-world environments. Existing embodied navigation methods
struggle with such tasks due to their limitations in comprehending high-level
human instructions and localizing objects with an open vocabulary. In this
paper, we propose $NavA^3$, a hierarchical framework divided into two stages:
global and local policies. In the global policy, we leverage the reasoning
capabilities of Reasoning-VLM to parse high-level human instructions and
integrate them with global 3D scene views. This allows us to reason and
navigate to regions most likely to contain the goal object. In the local
policy, we have collected a dataset of 1.0 million samples of spatial-aware
object affordances to train the NaviAfford model (PointingVLM), which provides
robust open-vocabulary object localization and spatial awareness for precise
goal identification and navigation in complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that $NavA^3$ achieves SOTA results in navigation
performance and can successfully complete longhorizon navigation tasks across
different robot embodiments in real-world settings, paving the way for
universal embodied navigation. The dataset and code will be made available.

Conclusion: RoboTron-Sim能有效提升自动驾驶在复杂场景中的表现。

Abstract: Collecting real-world data for rare high-risk scenarios, long-tailed driving
events, and complex interactions remains challenging, leading to poor
performance of existing autonomous driving systems in these critical
situations. In this paper, we propose RoboTron-Sim that improves real-world
driving in critical situations by utilizing simulated hard cases. First, we
develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios
(HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced
environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we
introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder
(I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn
real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental
deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios.
Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving
performance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art
results in real-world open-loop planning. Qualitative results further
demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboTron-Sim in better managing rare high-risk
driving scenarios. Project page: https://stars79689.github.io/RoboTron-Sim/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放世界语义导航的挑战，如在新环境中根据自然语言指令搜索目标物体。

Method: 采用模块化设计，结合基础模型和OSG表示，通过OSG模式自动生成环境模板，实现零样本适应。

Conclusion: OSG Navigator通过结合基础模型和OSG表示，有效解决了开放世界语义导航问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: How can we build general-purpose robot systems for open-world semantic
navigation, e.g., searching a novel environment for a target object specified
in natural language? To tackle this challenge, we introduce OSG Navigator, a
modular system composed of foundation models, for open-world Object-Goal
Navigation (ObjectNav). Foundation models provide enormous semantic knowledge
about the world, but struggle to organise and maintain spatial information
effectively at scale. Key to OSG Navigator is the Open Scene Graph
representation, which acts as spatial memory for OSG Navigator. It organises
spatial information hierarchically using OSG schemas, which are templates, each
describing the common structure of a class of environments. OSG schemas can be
automatically generated from simple semantic labels of a given environment,
e.g., "home" or "supermarket". They enable OSG Navigator to adapt zero-shot to
new environment types. We conducted experiments using both Fetch and Spot
robots in simulation and in the real world, showing that OSG Navigator achieves
state-of-the-art performance on ObjectNav benchmarks and generalises zero-shot
over diverse goals, environments, and robot embodiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多智能体框架技术先进，但其在机器人上的实际应用仍有限，阻碍了MARS研究的进展。

Method: 研究1使用CrewAI迭代优化知识库，识别协调失败；研究2使用AutoGen评估双向通信结构，比较推理与非推理模型的性能。

Result: 研究发现协调失败需更多改进，双向通信结构能提升性能，同时揭示了自主性与稳定性的矛盾。

Conclusion: 强调边缘案例测试对提升系统可靠性和安全性的重要性，为未来实际部署提供参考。

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by
integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of
action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of
advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains
limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this
gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of
hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot
healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the
system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination
failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure
reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2,
using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure
and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models

Abstract: Accurate system identification is crucial for reducing trajectory drift in
bipedal locomotion, particularly in reinforcement learning and model-based
control. In this paper, we present a novel control framework that integrates
system identification into the reinforcement learning training loop using
differentiable simulation. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on direct
torque measurements, our method estimates system parameters using only
trajectory data (positions, velocities) and control inputs. We leverage the
differentiable simulator MuJoCo-XLA to optimize system parameters, ensuring
that simulated robot behavior closely aligns with real-world motion. This
framework enables scalable and flexible parameter optimization. Accurate system

and flexible parameter optimization. It supports fundamental physical
properties such as mass and inertia. Additionally, it handles complex system
nonlinear behaviors, including advanced friction models, through neural network
approximations. Experimental results show that our framework significantly
improves trajectory following.
