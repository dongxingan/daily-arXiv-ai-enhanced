### [1] [Fluidically Innervated Lattices Make Versatile and Durable Tactile Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21225)
*Annan Zhang,Miguel Flores-Acton,Andy Yu,Anshul Gupta,Maggie Yao,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 介绍了一种基于3D打印弹性体晶格和嵌入式空气通道的被动软机器人指尖触觉传感器，通过检测密封空气通道内的压力变化实现触觉感知，具有简单、可扩展和耐用的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉感知对机器人在动态和非结构化环境中的导航至关重要，尤其是在精细物体操作、表面探索和人机交互等应用中。

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate
dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as
delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction.
In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated
tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded
air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,
transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes
within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile
sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials
or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material
fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric
model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately
predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the
fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,
demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile
feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading
conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of
simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for
versatile robotic manipulation.

### [2] [Diffusion Denoiser-Aided Gyrocompassing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21245)
*Gershy Ben-Arie,Daniel Engelsman,Rotem Dror,Itzik Klein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散去噪的陀螺罗盘方法，结合深度学习模型，显著提高了低成本陀螺仪的导航精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低成本陀螺仪在无外部导航辅助的场景下，其噪声严重影响导航精度，亟需解决方案。

Method: 将扩散去噪框架与增强的学习型航向估计模型结合，先对原始传感器信号去噪，再输入深度学习模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比传统模型精度提高26%，比其他学习方法提高15%。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本陀螺仪在自主平台中的精确导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: An accurate initial heading angle is essential for efficient and safe
navigation across diverse domains. Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide
accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a
process known as gyrocompassing. Yet, accurate and timely gyrocompassing, using
low-cost gyroscopes, remains a significant challenge in scenarios where
external navigation aids are unavailable. Such challenges are commonly
addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size,
weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements
severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we
propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a
diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading
estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals
before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing.
Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our
proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to
model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven
approaches. This advancement holds particular significance for ensuring
accurate and robust navigation in autonomous platforms that incorporate
low-cost gyroscopes within their navigation systems.

Result: 在Gazebo/ROS仿真和实际实验中验证了方法的有效性，实现了高频率NMPC实时执行。

Conclusion: 该方法为在资源受限设备上部署NMPC提供了可行方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a powerful approach for
controlling highly dynamic robotic systems, as it accounts for system dynamics
and optimizes control inputs at each step. However, its high computational
complexity makes implementation on resource-constrained microcontrollers
impractical. While recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of Model
Predictive Control (MPC) with linearized dynamics on microcontrollers, applying
full NMPC remains a significant challenge. This work presents an efficient
solution for generating and deploying NMPC on microcontrollers (NMPCM) to
control quadrotor UAVs. The proposed method optimizes computational efficiency
while maintaining high control accuracy. Simulations in Gazebo/ROS and
real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach,
demonstrating its capability to achieve high-frequency NMPC execution in
real-time systems. The code is available at:

Abstract: Terrestrial-aerial bimodal vehicles, which integrate the high mobility of
aerial robots with the long endurance of ground robots, offer significant
potential for autonomous exploration. Given the inherent energy and time
constraints in practical exploration tasks, we present a hierarchical framework
for the bimodal vehicle to utilize its flexible locomotion modalities for
exploration. Beginning with extracting environmental information to identify
informative regions, we generate a set of potential bimodal viewpoints. To
adaptively manage energy and time constraints, we introduce an extended Monte
Carlo Tree Search approach that strategically optimizes both modality selection
and viewpoint sequencing. Combined with an improved bimodal vehicle motion
planner, we present a complete bimodal energy- and time-aware exploration
system. Extensive simulations and deployment on a customized real-world
platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.

### [5] [Projecting the New Body: How Body Image Evolves During Learning to Walk with a Wearable Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21384)
*I-Chieh Lee,He Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了穿戴式机器人如何影响人体运动系统和感知，发现运动学习和感知身体图像共同进化，但感知与实际运动间存在持续差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统人体运动系统定义，研究穿戴式机器人对步态表现和身体感知的影响。

Method: 通过SCoMo测量步态表现和感知身体图像，基于人机系统运动学习理论提出假设。

Result: 运动学习改善了步态和感知，但感知与实际运动间存在差异，可能限制进一步改进。

Conclusion: 增强穿戴式机器人的感知和定期校准身体图像对有效训练和开发更人性化辅助技术至关重要。

Abstract: Advances in wearable robotics challenge the traditional definition of human
motor systems, as wearable robots redefine body structure, movement capability,
and perception of their own bodies. We measured gait performance and perceived
body images via Selected Coefficient of Perceived Motion, SCoMo, after each
training session. Based on human motor learning theory extended to wearer-robot
systems, we hypothesized that learning the perceived body image when walking
with a robotic leg co-evolves with the actual gait improvement and becomes more
certain and more accurate to the actual motion. Our result confirmed that motor
learning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal,
indicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into
their sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination.
However, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained,
likely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis
from wearers. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at the later training
sessions might limit further motor improvement. These findings suggest that
enhancing the human sense of wearable robots and frequent calibrating
perception of body image are essential for effective training with lower limb
wearable robots and for developing more embodied assistive technologies.

### [6] [Sound Source Localization for Human-Robot Interaction in Outdoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21431)
*Victor Liu,Timothy Du,Jordy Sehn,Jack Collier,François Grondin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于麦克风阵列和异步近场麦克风的声源定位方法，通过信号粗对齐和时域声学回声消除算法，实现了在噪声环境中的选择性声源定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在噪声环境中机器人如何准确识别操作者声音方向的问题，以实现更丰富的交互。

Method: 结合信号粗对齐策略和时域声学回声消除算法，估计时频理想比率掩码以隔离目标语音。

Result: 在1dB信噪比下，平均角度误差为4度，95%的定位精度在5度以内，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声环境中实现了高精度的声源定位，为机器人交互提供了可靠的方向信息。

Abstract: This paper presents a sound source localization strategy that relies on a
microphone array embedded in an unmanned ground vehicle and an asynchronous
close-talking microphone near the operator. A signal coarse alignment strategy
is combined with a time-domain acoustic echo cancellation algorithm to estimate
a time-frequency ideal ratio mask to isolate the target speech from
interferences and environmental noise. This allows selective sound source
localization, and provides the robot with the direction of arrival of sound
from the active operator, which enables rich interaction in noisy scenarios.
Results demonstrate an average angle error of 4 degrees and an accuracy within
5 degrees of 95\% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 1dB, which is significantly
superior to the state-of-the-art localization methods.

### [7] [Multifunctional physical reservoir computing in soft tensegrity robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21496)
*Ryo Terajima,Katsuma Inoue,Kohei Nakajima,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: cs.RO

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索软体机器人（如张力机器人）的非线性动力学在物理储层计算中的应用，以实现多行为控制，并研究其未训练吸引子对具身认知的启示。

Result: 系统表现出多稳态特性，并存在未训练的吸引子，反映了机器人与环境交互的内在特性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解具身认知的未充分探索特征提供了新视角，展示了PRC在具身AI研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be
utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical
reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such
physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to
compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own
behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and
embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called
a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the
environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different
attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis
reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the
system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the
intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its
interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC
remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential
to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully
addressed to date.

### [8] [Decision Transformer-Based Drone Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Safety-Efficiency Trade-Offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21506)
*Chang-Hun Ji,SiWoon Song,Youn-Hee Han,SungTae Moon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于决策变换器的无人机轨迹规划器，通过单一参数RTG动态调整安全与效率的权衡，无需专家知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多项式规划器需专家调参且难以实现理想权衡，而强化学习规划器未明确解决安全与效率的权衡问题。

Method: 采用决策变换器框架，引入RTG作为温度参数，直观衡量轨迹安全与效率。

Result: 实验表明，该规划器能通过RTG动态调整权衡，并在不同RTG设置下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提规划器在仿真和实际环境中均表现出可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the
safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in
unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer
computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert
knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even
with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired
trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are
adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the
safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single
parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically
adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively
measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require
expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both
structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results
demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency
trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner
outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating
safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when
tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability
and practicality of our proposed planner.

### [9] [LITE: A Learning-Integrated Topological Explorer for Multi-Floor Indoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21517)
*Junhao Chen,Zhen Zhang,Chengrui Zhu,Xiaojun Hou,Tianyang Hu,Huifeng Wu,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习集成的拓扑探索器LITE，用于多楼层室内环境，通过分解环境为楼层-楼梯拓扑，结合学习或非学习的2D探索方法，实现3D探索。实验表明其高效性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多楼层室内探索是一个开放的研究领域，现有方法多局限于2D环境，缺乏对3D环境的有效探索。

Method: 提出LITE框架，将环境分解为楼层-楼梯拓扑，结合YOLO11实例分割模型和有限状态机实现楼层切换，并采用基于注意力的2D探索策略。

Result: 在HM3D和MP3D数据集上显著优于基线方法，并在真实四足机器人上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: LITE框架有效支持多楼层室内探索，兼容多种2D方法，具有高效性和泛化潜力。

Abstract: This work focuses on multi-floor indoor exploration, which remains an open
area of research. Compared to traditional methods, recent learning-based
explorers have demonstrated significant potential due to their robust
environmental learning and modeling capabilities, but most are restricted to 2D
environments. In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological
explorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments. LITE decomposes the
environment into a floor-stair topology, enabling seamless integration of
learning or non-learning-based 2D exploration methods for 3D exploration. As we
incrementally build floor-stair topology in exploration using YOLO11-based
instance segmentation model, the agent can transition between floors through a
finite state machine. Additionally, we implement an attention-based 2D
exploration policy that utilizes an attention mechanism to capture spatial
dependencies between different regions, thereby determining the next global
goal for more efficient exploration. Extensive comparison and ablation studies
conducted on the HM3D and MP3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed 2D
exploration policy significantly outperforms all baseline explorers in terms of
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, experiments in several 3D multi-floor
environments indicate that our framework is compatible with various 2D
exploration methods, facilitating effective multi-floor indoor exploration.
Finally, we validate our method in the real world with a quadruped robot,
highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类示范数据通常模糊且不完整，需要一种既能模仿学习又能可靠规划的方法。

Method: 用规划代理替代IRL中的策略，结合对抗模仿学习，实现端到端观察学习。

Result: 在样本效率、分布外泛化和鲁棒性方面显著提升，并在仿真和真实导航实验中验证。

Conclusion: 该方法在解释性、复杂性、安全性及性能上均优于传统方法。

Abstract: Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating
imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A
common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this
reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we
derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With
connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables
end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only
demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and
safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency,
out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness. The study includes
evaluations in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation
experiments using few-to-single observation-only demonstrations.

### [11] [Pretraining a Unified PDDL Domain from Real-World Demonstrations for Generalizable Robot Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21545)
*Haoming Ye,Yunxiao Xiao,Cewu Lu,Panpan Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniDomain框架通过预训练PDDL领域，从机器人操作演示中提取原子领域，支持在线任务规划，显著提升任务成功率和规划最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs和VLMs在长时程结构和符号基础方面的不足，以及现有方法在泛化能力上的限制。

Method: 从12,393个操作视频中提取原子领域，构建统一领域，并融合为高质量元领域以支持组合泛化。

Result: 在零样本任务中，UniDomain任务成功率提升58%，规划最优性提升160%。

Conclusion: UniDomain通过统一领域和组合泛化，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Robotic task planning in real-world environments requires reasoning over
implicit constraints from language and vision. While LLMs and VLMs offer strong
priors, they struggle with long-horizon structure and symbolic grounding.
Existing methods that combine LLMs with symbolic planning often rely on
handcrafted or narrow domains, limiting generalization. We propose UniDomain, a
framework that pre-trains a PDDL domain from robot manipulation demonstrations
and applies it for online robotic task planning. It extracts atomic domains
from 12,393 manipulation videos to form a unified domain with 3137 operators,
2875 predicates, and 16481 causal edges. Given a target class of tasks, it
retrieves relevant atomics from the unified domain and systematically fuses
them into high-quality meta-domains to support compositional generalization in
planning. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks show that UniDomain solves
complex, unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner, achieving up to 58% higher task
success and 160% improvement in plan optimality over state-of-the-art LLM and
LLM-PDDL baselines.

the pipeline of a decentralized LiDAR SLAM system to study the current
limitations of the state of the art, and we discover a significant source of
failures, i.e., that the loop detection is the source of too many false
positives. We therefore develop and propose a new heuristic to overcome these
limitations. The environment taken as reference in this work is the highly
challenging case of underground tunnels. We also highlight potential new
research areas still under-explored.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology,
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for
extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility
beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from
both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as
limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant
technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the
End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features
two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end
planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the
challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established
a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper
describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research
problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and
heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among
top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication
and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and
reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM方法在动态环境中因假设静态环境而存在定位漂移问题，现有系统对视角突变和动态物体处理不足。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D数据集上的实验表明，该方法在动态场景下显著提高了定位精度和系统鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了动态环境中的SLAM定位漂移问题，为自主系统提供了更可靠的实时定位解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a vital role in
real-time localization for autonomous systems. However, traditional SLAM
methods, which assume a static environment, often suffer from significant
localization drift in dynamic scenarios. While recent advancements have
improved SLAM performance in such environments, these systems still struggle
with localization drift, particularly due to abrupt viewpoint changes and
poorly characterized moving objects. In this paper, we propose a novel
scene-object-based reliability assessment framework that comprehensively
evaluates SLAM stability through both current frame quality metrics and scene
changes relative to reliable reference frames. Furthermore, to tackle the lack
of error correction mechanisms in existing systems when pose estimation becomes
unreliable, we employ a pose refinement strategy that leverages information
from reliable frames to optimize camera pose estimation, effectively mitigating
the adverse effects of dynamic interference. Extensive experiments on the TUM
RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements
in localization accuracy and system robustness under challenging dynamic
scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在障碍物密集环境中，多无人机通信网络常因遮挡而受限，需通过多跳网络解决，但面临网络结构设计和动态连接维护的挑战。

Method: 提出基于最小边RRT*的约束搜索方法设计网络结构，采用分布式模型预测控制策略协调运动，明确纳入距离和视线连接约束。

Result: 理论保证所有无人机轨迹无碰撞且保持视线连接，仿真和硬件实验验证了动态适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多无人机在复杂环境中的通信网络部署和动态协调问题。

Abstract: A reliable communication network is essential for multiple UAVs operating
within obstacle-cluttered environments, where limited communication due to
obstructions often occurs. A common solution is to deploy intermediate UAVs to
relay information via a multi-hop network, which introduces two challenges: (i)
how to design the structure of multihop networks; and (ii) how to maintain
connectivity during collaborative motion. To this end, this work first proposes
an efficient constrained search method based on the minimumedge RRT? algorithm,
to find a spanning-tree topology that requires a less number of UAVs for the
deployment task. Then, to achieve this deployment, a distributed model
predictive control strategy is proposed for the online motion coordination. It
explicitly incorporates not only the inter-UAV and UAVobstacle distance
constraints, but also the line-of-sight (LOS) connectivity constraint. These
constraints are well-known to be nonlinear and often tackled by various
approximations. In contrast, this work provides a theoretical guarantee that
all agent trajectories are ensured to be collision-free with a teamwise LOS
connectivity at all time. Numerous simulations are performed in 3D valley-like
environments, while hardware experiments validate its dynamic adaptation when
the deployment position changes online.

Conclusion: MoDeSuite有望推动移动操作可变形物体的新研究领域。

Abstract: Mobile manipulation is a critical capability for robots operating in diverse,
real-world environments. However, manipulating deformable objects and materials
remains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various
benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid
objects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address
mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects.
  To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation
Deformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning.
MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both
elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge
inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires
effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as
the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and
demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art

Result: 实验表明，ExamPPO能有效调节对抗行为，暴露AV决策弱点，并在异构环境中泛化。

Conclusion: ExamPPO为自动驾驶决策系统的安全性和智能性评估提供了统一且可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific testing techniques are essential for ensuring the safe operation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), with high-risk, highly interactive scenarios
being a primary focus. To address the limitations of existing testing methods,
such as their heavy reliance on high-quality test data, weak interaction
capabilities, and low adversarial robustness, this paper proposes ExamPPO, an
interactive adversarial testing framework that enables scenario-adaptive and
intensity-controllable evaluation of autonomous vehicles. The framework models
the Surrounding Vehicle (SV) as an intelligent examiner, equipped with a
multi-head attention-enhanced policy network, enabling context-sensitive and
sustained behavioral interventions. A scalar confrontation factor is introduced
to modulate the intensity of adversarial behaviors, allowing continuous,
fine-grained adjustment of test difficulty. Coupled with structured evaluation
metrics, ExamPPO systematically probes AV's robustness across diverse scenarios
and strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios and AV
strategies demonstrate that ExamPPO can effectively modulate adversarial
behavior, expose decision-making weaknesses in tested AVs, and generalize
across heterogeneous environments, thereby offering a unified and reproducible
solution for evaluating the safety and intelligence of autonomous
decision-making systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高自动驾驶系统（ADS）与弱势道路使用者（VRUs，如骑行者）交互测试的真实性，以增强VRUs的安全性。

Method: 通过Unreal Engine 5开发的虚拟环境（VE），将骑行者循环测试台与车辆循环测试台耦合，实现双向交互。

Result: 验证实验表明该方法可行，并展示了其在ADS评估中的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 该耦合测试环境为ADS与VRUs交互的测试提供了安全且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Testing and evaluating automated driving systems (ADS) in interactions with
vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as cyclists, are essential for improving the
safety of VRUs, but often lack realism. This paper presents and validates a
coupled in-the-loop test environment that integrates a Cyclist-in-the Loop test
bench with a Vehicle-in-the-Loop test bench via a virtual environment (VE)
developed in Unreal Engine 5. The setup enables closed-loop, bidirectional
interaction between a real human cyclist and a real automated vehicle under
safe and controllable conditions. The automated vehicle reacts to cyclist
gestures via stimulated camera input, while the cyclist, riding a stationary
bicycle, perceives and reacts to the vehicle in the VE in real time. Validation
experiments are conducted using a real automated shuttle bus with a
track-and-follow function, performing three test maneuvers - straight-line
driving with stop, circular track driving, and double lane change - on a
proving ground and in the coupled in-the-loop test environment. The performance
is evaluated by comparing the resulting vehicle trajectories in both
environments. Additionally, the introduced latencies of individual components
in the test setup are measured. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach and highlight its strengths and limitations for realistic ADS
evaluation.

Abstract: One major recurring challenge in deploying manipulation robots is determining
the optimal placement of manipulators to maximize performance. This challenge
is exacerbated in complex, cluttered agricultural environments of high-value
crops, such as flowers, fruits, and vegetables, that could greatly benefit from
robotic systems tailored to their specific requirements. However, the design of
such systems remains a challenging, intuition-driven process, limiting the
affordability and adoption of robotics-based automation by domain experts like
farmers. To address this challenge, we propose a four-part design optimization
methodology for automating the development of task-specific robotic systems.
This framework includes (a) a robot design model, (b) task and environment
representations for simulation, (c) task-specific performance metrics, and (d)
optimization algorithms for refining configurations. We demonstrate our
framework by optimizing a dual-arm robotic system for pepper harvesting using
two off-the-shelf redundant manipulators. To enhance performance, we introduce
novel task metrics that leverage self-motion manifolds to characterize
manipulator redundancy comprehensively. Our results show that our framework
achieves simultaneous improvements in reachability success rates and
improvements in dexterity. Specifically, our approach improves reachability
success by at least 14\% over baseline methods and achieves over 30\%
improvement in dexterity based on our task-specific metric.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逆运动学（IK）求解器仅提供局部最优解，而SMMs能提供全局解，适用于冗余机械臂。

Result: 方法无需额外IK优化即可精确计算SMMs，并成功扩展到棱柱关节系统。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为冗余机械臂的全局IK解提供了有效工具，但存在局限性。

Abstract: Redundant manipulators are well understood to offer infinite joint
configurations for achieving a desired end-effector pose. The multiplicity of
inverse kinematics (IK) solutions allows for the simultaneous solving of
auxiliary tasks like avoiding joint limits or obstacles. However, the most
widely used IK solvers are numerical gradient-based iterative methods that
inherently return a locally optimal solution. In this work, we explore the
computation of self-motion manifolds (SMMs), which represent the set of all
joint configurations that solve the inverse kinematics problem for redundant
manipulators. Thus, SMMs are global IK solutions for redundant manipulators. We
focus on task redundancies of dimensionality 1, introducing a novel ODE
formulation for computing SMMs using standard explicit fixed-step ODE
integrators. We also address the challenge of ``inducing'' redundancy in
otherwise non-redundant manipulators assigned to tasks naturally described by
one degree of freedom less than the non-redundant manipulator. Furthermore,
recognizing that SMMs can consist of multiple disconnected components, we
propose methods for searching for these separate SMM components. Our
formulations and algorithms compute accurate SMM solutions without requiring
additional IK refinement, and we extend our methods to prismatic joint systems
-- an area not covered in current SMM literature. This manuscript presents the
derivation of these methods and several examples that show how the methods work
and their limitations.

Conclusion: 结合先进成像和深度学习可自动化显微手术任务，为RVC提供了更安全、可靠且精确的手术方案。

Abstract: Retinal vein cannulation (RVC) is a minimally invasive microsurgical
procedure for treating retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a leading cause of vision
impairment. However, the small size and fragility of retinal veins, coupled
with the need for high-precision, tremor-free needle manipulation, create
significant technical challenges. These limitations highlight the need for
robotic assistance to improve accuracy and stability. This study presents an
automated robotic system with a top-down microscope and B-scan optical
coherence tomography (OCT) imaging for precise depth sensing. Deep
learning-based models enable real-time needle navigation, contact detection,
and vein puncture recognition, using a chicken embryo model as a surrogate for
human retinal veins. The system autonomously detects needle position and
puncture events with 85% accuracy. The experiments demonstrate notable
reductions in navigation and puncture times compared to manual methods. Our
results demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced imaging and deep
learning to automate microsurgical tasks, providing a pathway for safer and
more reliable RVC procedures with enhanced precision and reproducibility.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) combined with reduced-order template models
has emerged as a powerful tool for trajectory optimization in dynamic legged
locomotion. However, loco-manipulation tasks performed by legged robots
introduce additional complexity, necessitating computationally efficient MPC
algorithms capable of handling high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) models. This letter
presents a computationally efficient nonlinear MPC (NMPC) framework tailored
for loco-manipulation tasks of quadrupedal robots equipped with robotic
manipulators whose dynamics are non-negligible relative to those of the
quadruped. The proposed framework adopts a decomposition strategy that couples
locomotion template models -- such as the single rigid body (SRB) model -- with
a full-order dynamic model of the robotic manipulator for torque-level control.
This decomposition enables efficient real-time solution of the NMPC problem in
a receding horizon fashion at 60 Hz. The optimal state and input trajectories
generated by the NMPC for locomotion are tracked by a low-level nonlinear
whole-body controller (WBC) running at 500 Hz, while the optimal torque
commands for the manipulator are directly applied. The layered control
architecture is validated through extensive numerical simulations and hardware
experiments on a 15-kg Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot augmented with a 4.4-kg
4-DoF Kinova arm. Given that the Kinova arm dynamics are non-negligible
relative to the Go2 base, the proposed NMPC framework demonstrates robust
stability in performing diverse loco-manipulation tasks, effectively handling
external disturbances, payload variations, and uneven terrain.
