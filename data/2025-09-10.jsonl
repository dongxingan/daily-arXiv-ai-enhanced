Recurrent controllers\nstruggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion\nincurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.\nWe present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a\nselective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable\nboth recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and\nnear-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations\n(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked\nSSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range\ndependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic\nself-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable\ntraining under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula\nthat randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene\ncomplexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy\nefficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach\nconsistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety\n(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the\nsame compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical\nfusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion\ncontrol."}

While explainability for behaviour trees has seen some prior\nattention, no existing methods are capable of generating causal, counterfactual\nexplanations which detail the reasons for robot decisions and behaviour.\nTherefore, in this work, we introduce a novel approach which automatically\ngenerates counterfactual explanations in response to contrastive \"why\"\nquestions.

The proposed framework investigates two RL methodologies Dynamic\nProgramming (DP) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to overcome the\nchallenges posed by the rotor failure mechanism of the quadcopter. DP, a\nmodel-based approach, is leveraged for its convergence guarantees, despite high\ncomputational demands, whereas DDPG, a model-free technique, facilitates rapid\ncomputation but with constraints on solution duration. The research challenge\narises from training RL algorithms on large dimensions and action domains. With\nmodifications to the existing DP and DDPG algorithms, the controllers were\ntrained not only to cater for large continuous state and action domain and also\nachieve a desired state after an inflight propeller failure. To verify the\nrobustness of the proposed control framework, extensive simulations were\nconducted in a MATLAB environment across various initial conditions and\nunderscoring its viability for mission-critical quadcopter applications.

Yet performance on contact-rich,\ndeformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,\neven with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency\nof existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.\nTo address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on\nhuman-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we\nfine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate\nrecovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human\noperators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot\nback to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective\nsegment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition\nexpands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,\nwhich we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on\nlong-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt\nhanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated\nassembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\\times$ less\ndata collection time and samples.

GF-VLA employs an\ninformation-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively\nhighlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions.
