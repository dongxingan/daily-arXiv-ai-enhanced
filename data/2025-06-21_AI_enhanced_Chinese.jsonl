Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe\nconsequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We\naddress this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1.\nWe address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a\nfine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an\nexpressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can\nrun in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found\nthis voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods\nof expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a\nrobot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices\nin various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy\nand high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate\nand makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an\nEnglish TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known\nlinguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used\na data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use\nduration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax\n(short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly\ninfluences the perception for L2 listeners and created an \"L2 clarity mode\" for\nMatcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels\nunchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and\nencouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these\nchallenging tense/lax minimal pairs.", "AI": {"tldr": "论文探讨了为语言教学机器人开发任务特定的合成语音，提出了轻量级、表达力强的语音系统，并优化了语音在不同环境中的适应性及对L2学习者的清晰度。", "motivation": "现有研究缺乏针对语言教学机器人的任务特定合成语音，可能影响教学效果。", "method": "1. 使用微调的Matcha-TTS和表情符号提示创建表达力强的语音；2. 调整语音以适应物理和社交环境；3. 开发针对L2学习者的清晰语音模式。", "result": "语音更具表达力、适应性更强，且对L2学习者更清晰、尊重和鼓励。", "conclusion": "提出的方法显著提升了语言教学机器人的语音效果，适用于多样化教学场景。"}}

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce GRIM (Grasp Re-alignment via Iterative\nMatching), a novel training-free framework for task-oriented grasping.\nInitially, a coarse alignment strategy is developed using a combination of\ngeometric cues and principal component analysis (PCA)-reduced DINO features for\nsimilarity scoring. Subsequently, the full grasp pose associated with the\nretrieved memory instance is transferred to the aligned scene object and\nfurther refined against a set of task-agnostic, geometrically stable grasps\ngenerated for the scene object, prioritizing task compatibility. In contrast to\nexisting learning-based methods, GRIM demonstrates strong generalization\ncapabilities, achieving robust performance with only a small number of\nconditioning examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRIM是一种无需训练的任务导向抓取框架，通过几何线索和PCA降维的DINO特征实现粗对齐，再通过任务无关的几何稳定抓取进行优化，表现出强大的泛化能力。", "motivation": "任务导向抓取（TOG）需要理解任务语义、对象功能及抓取约束，现有方法泛化能力不足，GRIM旨在解决这一问题。", "method": "GRIM采用粗对齐策略（几何线索+PCA降维DINO特征），再通过任务无关的几何稳定抓取优化抓取姿势。", "result": "GRIM仅需少量示例即可实现鲁棒性能，泛化能力强。", "conclusion": "GRIM为任务导向抓取提供了一种高效、无需训练的新方法，具有广泛应用潜力。"}}

Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion\ninformation while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of\nobjects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,\nwhile the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity\nand enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual\nrendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of\ndeformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse\nobjects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from\nsparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also\ngeneralizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,\nparticularly in scenarios with limited camera views.
