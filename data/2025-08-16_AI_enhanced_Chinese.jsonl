One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on\na diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.\nWhile achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that\nmay lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,\nthe stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of\ngenerated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,\nit can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training.
