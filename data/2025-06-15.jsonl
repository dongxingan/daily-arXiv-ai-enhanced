While robotic systems have been successfully deployed\nfor various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains\nchallenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In\nthis paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language\nmodels (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data\ncollection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To\nenhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task\nspecification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge\nhigh-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive\nexperiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this\ncontext, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing\nchallenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them."}

These limitations\nsignificantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present\nEmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It\nenables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and\nphotorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale\nin the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can\nbe directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained\nphysical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation.\nEmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key\nmodules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object\nGeneration, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates\ndiverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging\ngenerative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the\nneeds of embodied intelligence related research.

Two key bottlenecks remain\nin this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance\non fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose\nVision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\n(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for\nlocalization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity\ncommands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular\ncamera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a\nlarge language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into\nstructured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)\nthat matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a\nwaypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV\ncontrol. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without\nadditional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,\nreal-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and\nindirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary\ngoal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the\npresence of abstract language input."}

Existing\nlanguage-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are\nperfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and\ngeneralization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous,\nirrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional\nMAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen\nexecutable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we\nconstruct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective\ninstructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion,\nsafety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational\nVision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic\narms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level\nmanipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This\ndesign enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible\ncommands, and execute manipulation effectively.

Accurate state\nestimation, particularly of vehicle pose, is paramount for precise seafloor\nmapping, as even small surface deviations can have significant consequences\nwhen sensing the seafloor below. To address this challenge, we propose an\nInvariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework designed to integrate\npartial orientation measurements. While conventional estimation often relies on\nrelative position measurements to fixed landmarks, open ocean ASVs primarily\nobserve a receding horizon. We leverage forward-facing monocular cameras to\nestimate roll and pitch with respect to this horizon, which provides\nyaw-ambiguous partial orientation information. To effectively utilize these\nmeasurements within the InEKF, we introduce a novel framework for incorporating\nsuch partial orientation data. This approach contrasts with traditional InEKF\nimplementations that assume full orientation measurements and is particularly\nrelevant for planar vehicle motion constrained to a \"seafaring plane.\" This\npaper details the developed InEKF framework; its integration with horizon-based\nroll/pitch observations and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements for ASV state\nestimation; and provides a comparative analysis against the InEKF using full\norientation and a Multiplicative EKF (MEKF).

In this task, while handling a secondary task,\nhumans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually\ncontrol it. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long\nexplanations, apology and promise, and denial.\n  Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an\nInput-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and\nhuman action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely\nto deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high.

We\naccomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a\n360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports\nrendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze\non top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the\nhand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye\nobservations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct\naction predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks\ntowards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements\na foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small\ncompute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable\nfixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.\nWe evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring\nmanipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm.
