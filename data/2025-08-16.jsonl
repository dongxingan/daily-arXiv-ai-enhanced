The nature and criticality of\nfailures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be\ngeneralized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been\nimplemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique\noverlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight\nthese failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the\nmethodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on\nour personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the\nstrength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a\nmulti-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of\nrobots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted\nfrom research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing\ninteraction evaluation methods."}

However,\nthe deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty\nwheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international\nstandards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical\ncontrol policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with\ndiffering levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and\ndeployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance\nunder nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach\na level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined\nthreshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary\ncontrol policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)\npolicy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring\nstability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system\nrobustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a\nhigh-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during\noperation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently\nsevere such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would\njeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC\npolicy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while\nadhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed\napproach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg\nWMR."}

The tool enables users to define material\nproperties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real\ntime. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it\naims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four\nbenchmark models - a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -\ndemonstrate its functionality.

The robot\nselects the next locations to reach using an exploration strategy. To do so,\nthe robot has to balance between competing objectives, like exploring the\nentirety of the environment, while being as fast as possible. Most exploration\nstrategies try to maximise the explored area to speed up exploration; however,\nthey do not consider that parts of the environment are more important than\nothers, as they lead to the discovery of large unknown areas. We propose a\nmethod that identifies \\emph{saliency areas} as those areas that are of high\ninterest for exploration, by using saliency maps obtained from a neural network\nthat, given the current map, implements a termination criterion to estimate\nwhether the environment can be considered fully-explored or not. We use\nsaliency areas to bias some widely used exploration strategies, showing, with\nan extensive experimental campaign, that this knowledge can significantly\ninfluence the behavior of the robot during exploration."}

Managing this redundancy is key to achieving\nreliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks\n(SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified\nframework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting\ntheir adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework\nthat automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from\nuser-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic\nProgramming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies\nwithout manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as\nprecision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate\nour method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a\ndual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned\nSoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs,\nbalancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This\napproach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy\nmanagement in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and\nreducing the need for expert design."}

A key concern is\nassuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe\ndecision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common\nenvironmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To\naddress this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)\nPerceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically\nanalyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations\nnegatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State\nTrees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model\nhow these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or\npose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to\nquantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote\nrigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust\nin autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for\nidentifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks."}

While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature\nto characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,\nlittle work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are\nable to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to\nmodel specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.\nIt is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction\nwith and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In\nthis paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based\non models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a\nlarge self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss\nfunction, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both\nclassification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that\nthe best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1\nscore of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result\nmakes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an\ninteraction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in\nsocial robots with social cognition."}

Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation\naccuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade\nlocalization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two\nmain factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system\nobservability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to\nimproper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a\nconsistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system\nbased on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the\nsystem state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and\nenabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states.\nFurthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant\nerror properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO\nalgorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace,\nthereby preserving estimation consistency.

By\nformulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom\nOpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using\nclassical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of\nthe orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right\nascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted\nterrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x\nhigher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer\ntimesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission\nobjectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational\nefficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications.
