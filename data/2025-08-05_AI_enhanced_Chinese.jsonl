These include both temporary and\npermanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly\ndegrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite\nits practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in\nthe literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the\ncomplexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware\ncoordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot\ntarget tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our\napproach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1)\nprobabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent\nsensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding\ninferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or\ncommunication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized\nbehavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned\ninto subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and\ncollaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots\nexperiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate\nindependently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them\nto contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate\nour method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive\nassessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our\nframework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments\nwith unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for\nthe multi-robot systems community.", "AI": {"tldr": "提出了一种统一的故障感知协调框架，用于在临时和永久故障条件下实现多机器人目标跟踪的鲁棒性和适应性。", "motivation": "现实世界中的多机器人协调常因传感和通信故障而性能下降，但现有研究对此关注不足。", "method": "通过区分临时和永久故障，将机器人分组处理：连接机器人协作规划，断开机器人独立优化。", "result": "在多种故障场景下，框架表现出鲁棒性能，适用于未知危险区域。", "conclusion": "该框架为多机器人系统提供了一种实用且通用的故障感知解决方案。"}}

Here, in this study, we propose a robot\nthat autonomously connects multiple wires to the environment by employing a\nmulti-small flying anchor system, as well as an RGB-D camera-based control and\nenvironmental recognition method. Each flying anchor is a drone with an\nanchoring mechanism at the wire tip, allowing the robot to attach wires by\nflying into position. Using the robot's RGB-D camera to identify suitable\nattachment points and a flying anchor position, the system can connect wires in\nenvironments that are not specially prepared, and can also attach multiple\nwires simultaneously.
