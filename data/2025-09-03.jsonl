However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and\ndisaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete\nperception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To\nenhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire\nscenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire\nprevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency\nresponse documents.

The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs\nfrom real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide\ninterpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component\nconfiguration based on the evolving risk situation.

Therefore, Task and Motion\nPlanning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or\neven in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete\naction sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In\nthis paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,\nreferred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different\nscenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,\nwhich expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop\nmotion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,\nTMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a\ncertain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate\nfor unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled\nautonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)\nbounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of\nunfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative\npaths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We\nuse a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous\nrobots.

For example, vision-based object-relative\nnavigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the\nrelative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's\nstate estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep\nNeural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state\nestimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we\nshow that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor\nfor aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer\nperceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL\npredictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing\npre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as\na measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman\nfilter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the\nstate estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the\ndynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of\nthe object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance\napproach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to\nunderline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the\nobject-relative state estimation task."}

One such approach to few-shot\nimitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts\nrelevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a\nlimited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior\ndatasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data\npoint's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.\nWhile retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data\nselection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel\ndensity (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two\nshortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on\nhigh-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,\nit does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To\naddress these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which\nestimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data\ndistributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the\nprobability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,\nand by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates\nusing all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world\nevaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently\nimproves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only\nrequiring minor modifications."}
