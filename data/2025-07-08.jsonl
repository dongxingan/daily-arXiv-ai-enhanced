In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e.\njoint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering\nangle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model\nwhere the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor\nattached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to\nrotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes\nmultiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as\nstability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as\nwell as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We\nuse perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under\nsymmetric periodic solution. Then, we utilize harmonic balance and further\nscaling assumptions in order to approximate the conditions for\nsymmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation and stability transition of the\nsymmetric periodic solution, as a function of actuation frequency and\nstructural parameters. The asymptotic results show good agreement with\nnumerical simulations.

To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying\nscenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to\nachieve, or switch between different frameworks.
