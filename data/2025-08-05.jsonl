To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline\ntailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of\nrose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection\non stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural\nnetwork.

The system model is considered to have uncertain model\nparameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update\nthe model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic\nestimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error\nreduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives\ngenerated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model\nselected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also\nequipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal\nestimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall\nmotion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the\nsize of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive\nlearning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well\nas in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter\nand the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of\nthe implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go\narbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with\nthe true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion\nplanning performance over time.

To address panoramic distortions in\nwide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream\narchitecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail\nenhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.\nWe further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training\ndata for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the\nperformance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and\nmodel weights will be publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer."}

These include both temporary and\npermanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly\ndegrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite\nits practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in\nthe literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the\ncomplexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware\ncoordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot\ntarget tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our\napproach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1)\nprobabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent\nsensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding\ninferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or\ncommunication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized\nbehavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned\ninto subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and\ncollaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots\nexperiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate\nindependently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them\nto contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate\nour method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive\nassessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our\nframework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments\nwith unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for\nthe multi-robot systems community."}

However, for practical use, robots must autonomously attach\nmultiple wires to the environment based on environmental recognition-an\noperation so difficult that many wire-driven robots remain restricted to\nspecialized, pre-designed environments. Here, in this study, we propose a robot\nthat autonomously connects multiple wires to the environment by employing a\nmulti-small flying anchor system, as well as an RGB-D camera-based control and\nenvironmental recognition method. Each flying anchor is a drone with an\nanchoring mechanism at the wire tip, allowing the robot to attach wires by\nflying into position. Using the robot's RGB-D camera to identify suitable\nattachment points and a flying anchor position, the system can connect wires in\nenvironments that are not specially prepared, and can also attach multiple\nwires simultaneously. Through this approach, a wire-driven robot can\nautonomously attach its wires to the environment, thereby realizing the\nbenefits of wire-driven operation at any location."}

We\nvalidate our approach in real orchard environments with a custom-built\nquadrotor platform. Field experiments demonstrate that after only a few\niterations of training, the proposed VAE-based controller can autonomously\nnavigate the UAV based on a front-mounted camera stream. The controller\nexhibits strong obstacle avoidance performance, achieves longer flying\ndistances with less human assistance, and outperforms existing algorithms.\nFurthermore, we show that the policy generalizes effectively to novel\nenvironments and maintains competitive performance across varying conditions\nand speeds. This research not only advances UAV autonomy but also holds\nsignificant potential for precision agriculture, improving efficiency in\norchard monitoring and management."}

In this work, we\nintroduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that\nsystematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual\nmonitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for\nembodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system\nfirst decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program\ngrounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed\nin simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected\ncheckpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure\nreasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events\nwith VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and\nrepairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting\nprogram synthesis with minimal human supervision.

Our grasping method employs antipodal sampling with\nforce closure to grasp limbs, and our repositioning system utilizes the Model\nPredictive Path Integral (MPPI) and vector-field-based control method to\ngenerate motion trajectories under collision avoidance and biomechanical\nconstraints. We evaluate this approach across various limb manipulation tasks\nin both supine and sitting positions and compare outcomes for different age\ngroups with differing shoulder joint limits.
