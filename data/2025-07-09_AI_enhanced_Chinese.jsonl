Incorporating\ngeometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this\nredundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we\nintroduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical\nframework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric\ninductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it\nprovides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric\nprimitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks\nto reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable\noperations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that\nincorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging\nits E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts\na hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action\ndecoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising\nprocess. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and\nreal-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task\nperformance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but\nalso achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model\ncompared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.", "AI": {"tldr": "hPGA-DP是一种结合了投影几何代数（PGA）的扩散策略方法，通过几何归纳偏置提升机器人学习中的训练效率和任务性能。", "motivation": "扩散策略在机器人学习中需要反复学习基础空间表示，导致冗余。通过引入几何归纳偏置可以解决这一问题。", "method": "提出hPGA-DP，结合PGA框架和P-GATr，采用混合架构（U-Net或Transformer）进行去噪。", "result": "实验表明hPGA-DP提升了任务性能和训练效率，并实现更快收敛。", "conclusion": "hPGA-DP通过几何偏置和混合架构显著优化了扩散策略的效果。"}}

In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in\nrobot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),\nembodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the\nconventional intuition of \"more diverse is better\". Throughout extensive\nexperiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity\nproves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer\nfrom diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)\nmulti-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment\ntransfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently\ntransfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during\nfine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,\narising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in\nhuman demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity\nmultimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we\npropose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the\nyielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to\nusing 2.5 times pre-training data.

While object-centric flow\nprediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios\ninvolving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion.

Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's\ninherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile\nmanipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and\nnon-object-displacement tasks.
