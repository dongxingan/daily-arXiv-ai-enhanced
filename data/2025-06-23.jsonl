Furthermore, to mitigate the\ndependency on costly human monitoring, this learning process should be\nperformed in a safe and autonomous manner. We present SafeMimic, a framework to\nlearn new mobile manipulation skills safely and autonomously from a single\nthird-person human video. Given an initial human video demonstration of a\nmulti-step mobile manipulation task, SafeMimic first parses the video into\nsegments, inferring both the semantic changes caused and the motions the human\nexecuted to achieve them and translating them to an egocentric reference.

While force control is essential for achieving compliant\ninteraction and high-frequency adaptation, it is limited to operations in close\nproximity to the manipulated object and often fails to maintain stable\norientation during extended motion sequences. Conversely, optimization-based\nmotion planning excels in generating collision-free trajectories over the\nrobot's configuration space but struggles with dynamic interactions where\ncontact forces play a crucial role. To address these limitations, we propose a\nmulti-modal control framework that combines force control and\noptimization-augmented motion planning to tackle complex robotic manipulation\ntasks in a sequential manner, enabling seamless switching between control modes\nbased on task requirements. Our approach decomposes complex tasks into\nsubtasks, each dynamically assigned to one of three control modes: Pure\noptimization for global motion planning, pure force control for precise\ninteraction, or hybrid control for tasks requiring simultaneous trajectory\ntracking and force regulation. This framework is particularly advantageous for\nbimanual and multi-arm manipulation, where synchronous motion and coordination\namong arms are essential while considering both the manipulated object and\nenvironmental constraints.

Traditional MPPI, which relies on a probabilistic\nsampling process, often struggles with constraint satisfaction and generates\nsuboptimal trajectories due to the weighted averaging of sampled trajectories.\nTo address these limitations, the proposed framework integrates a primal-dual\ngradient-based approach and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications\nwith Noise (DBSCAN) to steer sampled input trajectories into feasible regions\nwhile mitigating risks associated with weighted averaging. First, to ensure\nthat sampled trajectories remain within the feasible region, the primal-dual\ngradient method is applied to iteratively shift sampled inputs while enforcing\nstate and control constraints. Then, DBSCAN groups the sampled trajectories,\nenabling the selection of representative control inputs within each cluster.\nFinally, among the representative control inputs, the one with the lowest cost\nis chosen as the optimal action. As a result, CSC-MPPI guarantees constraint\nsatisfaction, improves trajectory selection, and enhances robustness in complex\nenvironments.

In this work, we propose a hybrid,\nrule-based planning framework that combines Priority Inheritance with\nBacktracking (PiBT) with a novel safety-aware path smoothing method. Our\napproach extends PiBT to 8-connected grids and selectively applies\nstring-pulling based smoothing while preserving collision safety through local\ninteraction awareness and a fallback collision resolution step based on Safe\nInterval Path Planning (SIPP). This design allows us to reduce overall path\nlengths while maintaining real-time performance. We demonstrate that our method\ncan scale to over 500 agents in large free-space environments, outperforming\nexisting any-angle and optimal methods in terms of runtime, while producing\nnear-optimal trajectories in sparse domains. Our results suggest this framework\nis a promising building block for scalable, real-time multi-agent navigation in\nrobotics systems operating beyond grid constraints."}

To deploy robots in collaborative setting, like houses, being\nable to receive and handing over objects safely and efficiently becomes a\ncrucial skill. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) for dexterous object handover between two multi-finger hands. Key to this\ntask is the use of a novel reward function based on dual quaternions to\nminimize the rotation distance, which outperforms other rotation\nrepresentations such as Euler and rotation matrices. The robustness of the\ntrained policy is experimentally evaluated by testing w.r.t. objects that are\nnot included in the training distribution, and perturbations during the\nhandover process. The results demonstrate that the trained policy successfully\nperform this task, achieving a total success rate of 94% in the best-case\nscenario after 100 experiments, thereby showing the robustness of our policy\nwith novel objects. In addition, the best-case performance of the policy\ndecreases by only 13.8% when the other robot moves during the handover, proving\nthat our policy is also robust to this type of perturbation, which is common in\nreal-world object handovers."}

However, existing work\ntypically treats these two tasks independently, which may neglect the interplay\nbetween radar's spatial and Doppler domain features, potentially introducing\nadditional bias. In this paper, we observe an underlying correlation between 3D\npoints and ego velocity, which offers reciprocal benefits for PCE and EVE. To\nfully unlock such inspiring potential, we take the first step to design a\nSpatial-Doppler Diffusion (SDDiff) model for simultaneously dense PCE and\naccurate EVE. To seamlessly tailor it to radar perception, SDDiff improves the\nconventional latent diffusion process in three major aspects. First, we\nintroduce a representation that embodies both spatial occupancy and Doppler\nfeatures. Second, we design a directional diffusion with radar priors to\nstreamline the sampling. Third, we propose Iterative Doppler Refinement to\nenhance the model's adaptability to density variations and ghosting effects.\nExtensive evaluations show that SDDiff significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by achieving 59% higher in EVE accuracy, 4X greater\nin valid generation density while boosting PCE effectiveness and reliability."}

The proposed controller achieved\nthe average of 0.28 m landing error when throwing at targets located 6 m away.\nFurthermore, in a comparative study with university students, the system\nachieved a velocity tracking error of 0.398 m/s and a success rate of 56.8%,\nhitting small targets randomly placed at distances of 3-5 m while throwing at a\nspecified speed of 6 m/s.

At\npresent, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth\nsensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision,\nwhich can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras),\nand fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art\nmonocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths\nup to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful\nzero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a\nnovel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover\nmetric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on\nMDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera\ncalibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate\ndepth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the\ntesting setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects,\ndemonstrating strong generalization capabilities.
