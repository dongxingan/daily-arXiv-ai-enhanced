ROBOT", "summary": "Driven by breakthroughs in next-generation artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence is rapidly advancing into industrial manufacturing. In flexible manufacturing, industrial embodied intelligence faces three core challenges: accurate process modeling and monitoring under limited perception, dynamic balancing between flexible adaptation and high-precision control, and the integration of general-purpose skills with specialized industrial operations. Accordingly, this survey reviews existing work from three viewpoints: Industrial Eye, Industrial Hand, and Industrial Brain. At the perception level (Industrial Eye), multimodal data fusion and real-time modeling in complex dynamic settings are examined. At the control level (Industrial Hand), flexible, adaptive, and precise manipulation for complex manufacturing processes is analyzed. At the decision level (Industrial Brain), intelligent optimization methods for process planning and line scheduling are summarized. By considering multi-level collaboration and interdisciplinary integration, this work reveals the key technological pathways of embodied intelligence for closed-loop optimization of perception-decision-execution in manufacturing systems. A three-stage evolution model for the development of embodied intelligence in flexible manufacturing scenarios, comprising cognition enhancement, skill transition, and system evolution, is proposed, and future development trends are examined, to offer both a theoretical framework and practical guidance for the interdisciplinary advancement of industrial embodied intelligence in the context of flexible manufacturing."}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning, their potential for coordinated control has not been fully explored. Inspired by human teamwork, we present CLiMRS (Cooperative Large-Language-Model-Driven Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System), an adaptive group negotiation framework among LLMs for multi-robot collaboration. This framework pairs each robot with an LLM agent and dynamically forms subgroups through a general proposal planner. Within each subgroup, a subgroup manager leads perception-driven multi-LLM discussions to get commands for actions. Feedback is provided by both robot execution outcomes and environment changes. This grouping-planning-execution-feedback loop enables efficient planning and robust execution. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CLiMBench, a heterogeneous multi-robot benchmark of challenging assembly tasks. Our experiments show that CLiMRS surpasses the best baseline, achieving over 40% higher efficiency on complex tasks without sacrificing success on simpler ones. Overall, our results demonstrate that leveraging human-inspired group formation and negotiation principles significantly enhances the efficiency of heterogeneous multi-robot collaboration.

We introduce KANLoc, a monocular localization framework that tightly couples VO with a lightweight but robust absolute pose regressor. At its core is a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that learns the complex mapping from image features to map coordinates, producing sparse but highly reliable global pose anchors. These anchors are fused into a bundle adjustment framework, effectively canceling drift while retaining local motion precision. KANLoc delivers three key advances: (i) a KAN-based pose regressor that achieves high accuracy with remarkable parameter efficiency, (ii) a hybrid VO-absolute localization scheme that yields globally consistent real-time trajectories (>=15 FPS), and (iii) a tailored data augmentation strategy that improves robustness to sensor occlusion. On both realistic synthetic and real lunar landing datasets, KANLoc reduces average translation and rotation error by 32% and 45%, respectively, with per-trajectory gains of up to 45%/48%, outperforming strong baselines."}

We first discuss the medical aerial delivery mission requirements and suitable uncrewed aerial system (UAS) configurations. We then address payload container design and optimization, and its effect on supplies and overall flight dynamics. We also explore the fundamental principles of GNC in the context of medical drone operations, highlighting key challenges arising from vibration, air temperature, pressure, and humidity, which affect the quality of medical supplies. The paper examines various GNC algorithms that can mitigate these challenges, as well as the algorithms' limitations. With these considerations, this survey aims to provide insights into optimizing GNC frameworks for medical drones, emphasizing research gaps and directions to improve real-world healthcare applications."}

Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research", "summary": "As hardware and software systems have grown in complexity, formal methods have been indispensable tools for rigorously specifying acceptable behaviors, synthesizing programs to meet these specifications, and validating the correctness of existing programs. In the field of robotics, a similar trend of rising complexity has emerged, driven in large part by the adoption of deep learning. While this shift has enabled the development of highly performant robot policies, their implementation as deep neural networks has posed challenges to traditional formal analysis, leading to models that are inflexible, fragile, and difficult to interpret. In response, the robotics community has introduced new formal and semi-formal methods to support the precise specification of complex objectives, guide the learning process to achieve them, and enable the verification of learned policies against them. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of how formal methods have been used in recent robot learning research. We organize our discussion around two pillars: policy learning and policy verification. For both, we highlight representative techniques, compare their scalability and expressiveness, and summarize how they contribute to meaningfully improving realistic robot safety and correctness. We conclude with a discussion of remaining obstacles for achieving that goal and promising directions for advancing formal methods in robot learning."}

This work demonstrates that reliable multifingered grasping can be achieved under extremely minimal sensing by relying solely on uniaxial fingertip force feedback and joint proprioception, without vision or multi-axis/tactile sensing. To enable such blind grasping, we employ an efficient teacher-student training pipeline in which a reinforcement-learned teacher exploits privileged simulation-only observations to generate demonstrations for distilling a transformer-based student policy operating under partial observation. The student policy is trained to act using only sensing modalities available at real-world deployment. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware across 18 objects, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, achieving a 98.3~$\\%$ overall grasp success rate. These results demonstrate strong robustness and generalization beyond the simulation training distribution, while significantly reducing sensing requirements for real-world grasping systems."}

In unseen, unmapped, or GPS-denied settings, traditional metric map-based methods fall short, prompting a shift toward learning-based approaches with minimal exploration. In this work, we develop a hierarchical framework that decomposes the navigation decision-making process into multiple levels. Our method learns to select subgoals through a simple, transferable waypoint selection network. A key component of the approach is a latent-space memory module organized solely by visual similarity, as a proxy for distance. This alternative to graph-based topological representations proves sufficient for navigation tasks, providing a compact, light-weight, simple-to-train navigator that can find its way to the goal in novel locations. We show competitive results with a suite of SOTA methods in Habitat AI environments without using any odometry in training or inference. An additional contribution leverages the interpretablility of the framework for interactive navigation. We consider the question: how much direction intervention/interaction is needed to achieve success in all trials? We demonstrate that even minimal human involvement can significantly enhance overall navigation performance."}

The objective is that all powered and unpowered cells motion can safely track a desired affine transformation, where an affine transformation can be decomposed into translation, rigid body rotation, and deformation. To this end, the paper first uses a deep neural network to structure cell interconnection in such a way that every cell can freely move over the deformation plane, and the entire structure can reconfigurably deform to track a desired affine transformation. Then, the mobile robots, contained by the powered cells and stepper motors, regulating the connections of the powered and unpowered cells, design the proper controls so that all cells safely track the desired affine transformation. The functionality of the proposed ATUGV is validated through hardware experimentation and simulation."}

Sliding Mode Control (SMC) has emerged as a robust approach for managing uncertainties and disturbances in manipulator dynamics, providing superior control performance compared to traditional methods. This study implements a model-based SMC (MBSMC) utilizing a hyperbolic tangent function to regulate the motion of a manipulator mounted on a mobile platform operating inside a self-driving chemical laboratory. Given the manipulator's role in transporting fragile glass vessels filled with hazardous chemicals, the controller is specifically designed to minimize abrupt transitions and achieve gentle, accurate trajectory tracking. The proposed controller is benchmarked against a non-model-based SMC (NMBSMC) and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller using a comprehensive set of joint and Cartesian metrics. Compared to PID and NMBSMC, MBSMC achieved significantly smoother motion and up to 90% lower control effort, validating its robustness and precision for autonomous laboratory operations. Experimental trials confirmed successful execution of tasks such as vessel grasping and window operation, which failed under PID control due to its limited ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances, resulting in substantial trajectory tracking errors. The results validate the controller's effectiveness in achieving smooth, precise, and safe manipulator motions, supporting the advancement of intelligent mobile manipulators in autonomous laboratory environments."}

The combination of a sensor suite, estimators, and a low-level controller achieved centimeter-scale positional flight accuracy. Additionally, we developed a hierarchical controller in which a human operator provides high-level commands to direct the robot's motion. In a 30-second flight experiment conducted outside a motion capture system, the robot avoided obstacles and ultimately landed on a sunflower. This level of sensing and computational autonomy represents a significant advancement for the aerial microrobotics community, further opening opportunities to explore onboard planning and power autonomy."}

To address the resulting semantic-geometric discrepancy and mitigate the memory consumption, we further design a multi-criteria map management strategy that prunes redundant or inconsistent Gaussians while preserving scene integrity. Finally, a hybrid field optimization framework jointly refines the geometric and semantic fields under real-time constraints by decoupling their optimization frequencies according to field characteristics. The proposed system achieves superior geometric fidelity compared to geometric-only baselines and comparable semantic fidelity to offline approaches while operating at 15 FPS.

The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery.

We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications. Finally, integrated solutions performing joint communications and SLAM are still in their infancy: theoretical and practical advancements are required to add higher-level localization and semantic perception capabilities to RF and multi-antenna technologies."}

These environments often involve delicate laboratory equipment, unpredictable environmental interactions, and occasional human intervention, making compliant and force aware control essential for ensuring safety, adaptability, and reliability. This paper introduces a motion-planning framework centered on admittance control to enable adaptive and compliant robotic manipulation. Unlike conventional schemes, the proposed approach integrates an admittance controller directly into trajectory execution, allowing the manipulator to dynamically respond to external forces during interaction. This capability enables human operators to override or redirect the robot's motion in real time. A vision algorithm based on structured planar pose estimation is employed to detect and localize textured planar objects through feature extraction, homography estimation, and depth fusion, thereby providing an initial target configuration for motion planning. The vision based initialization establishes the reference trajectory, while the embedded admittance controller ensures that trajectory execution remains safe, adaptive, and responsive to external forces or human intervention. The proposed strategy is validated using textured image detection as a proof of concept. Future work will extend the framework to SDL environments involving transparent laboratory objects where compliant motion planning can further enhance autonomy, safety, and human-robot collaboration."}

However, traditional Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) methods struggle to scale in this domain. While HARA relies on enumerating risks for finite and pre-defined function lists, Embodied AI operates on open-ended natural language instructions, creating a challenge of combinatorial interaction risks. Whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this scalability challenge, they often lack physical grounding, yielding semantically superficial and incoherent hazard descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework ARGOS (AttRibute-Guided cOmbinatorial reaSoning), which bridges the gap between open-ended user instructions and concrete physical attributes. By dynamically decomposing entities from instructions into these fine-grained properties, ARGOS grounds LLM reasoning in causal risk factors to generate physically plausible hazard scenarios. It then instantiates abstract safety standards, such as ISO 13482, into context-specific Functional Safety Requirements (FSRs) by integrating these scenarios with robot capabilities. Extensive experiments validate that ARGOS produces high-quality FSRs and outperforms baselines in identifying long-tail risks. Overall, this work paves the way for systematic and grounded functional safety requirement generation, a critical step toward the safe industrial deployment of Embodied AI."}

However, most of these techniques rely on impulsive energy injection schemes and torsional springs, which are quite challenging to implement in a physical platform.

Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors (e.g.,~lidar) have proven useful in mobile robotics, where high-resolution sensors can be used for simultaneous localization and mapping. In soft and continuum robotics, however, these high-resolution sensors are too large for practical use. This, combined with the deformable nature of such robots, has resulted in continuum robot (CR) localization and mapping in unstructured environments being a largely untouched area. In this work, we present a localization technique for CRs that relies on small, low-resolution ToF sensors distributed along the length of the robot. By fusing measurement information with a robot shape prior, we show that accurate localization is possible despite each sensor experiencing frequent degenerate scenarios. We achieve an average localization error of 2.5cm in position and 7.2° in rotation across all experimental conditions with a 53cm long robot. We demonstrate that the results are repeated across multiple environments, in both simulation and real-world experiments, and study robustness in the estimation to deviations in the prior map."}

Introducing greater autonomy to these systems can simultaneously make them more effective as well as reliable. Thus, the ability to rapidly engineer and deploy autonomous aerial systems has become of strategic importance. In the 2010s, a combination of high-performance compute, data, and open-source software led to the current deep learning and AI boom, unlocking decades of prior theoretical work. Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term \"simulation-to-reality gap\". These span from modeling shortcomings to the complexity of vertically integrating the highly heterogeneous hardware and software systems typically found in field robots. To address the latter, we introduce aerial-autonomy-stack, an open-source, end-to-end framework designed to streamline the pipeline from (GPU-accelerated) perception to (flight controller-based) action. Our stack allows the development of aerial autonomy using ROS2 and provides a common interface for two of the most popular autopilots: PX4 and ArduPilot. We show that it supports over 20x faster-than-real-time, end-to-end simulation of a complete development and deployment stack -- including edge compute and networking -- significantly compressing the build-test-release cycle of perception-based autonomy."}

However, the standard practice of sampling from random Gaussian noise often requires multiple iterative steps to produce clean actions, leading to high inference latency that incurs a major bottleneck for real-time control. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations. Lastly, we also extend A2A to video generation, demonstrating its broader versatility in temporal modeling. Project site: https://lorenzo-0-0.github.io/A2A_Flow_Matching."}

This work demonstrates that reliable multifingered grasping can be achieved under extremely minimal sensing by relying solely on uniaxial fingertip force feedback and joint proprioception, without vision or multi-axis/tactile sensing. To enable such blind grasping, we employ an efficient teacher-student training pipeline in which a reinforcement-learned teacher exploits privileged simulation-only observations to generate demonstrations for distilling a transformer-based student policy operating under partial observation. The student policy is trained to act using only sensing modalities available at real-world deployment. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware across 18 objects, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, achieving a 98.3~$\\%$ overall grasp success rate.

Safe locomotion in these settings requires long-horizon goal progress, passability over uneven terrain and static constraints, and collision avoidance against high-speed dynamic obstacles. A single system cannot fully satisfy all three objectives simultaneously: planning-based decisions can be too slow, while purely reactive decisions can sacrifice goal progress and passability. To resolve this conflict, we propose UEREBot (Unstructured-Environment Reflexive Evasion Robot), a hierarchical framework that separates slow planning from instantaneous reflexive evasion and coordinates them during execution. UEREBot formulates the task as a constrained optimal control problem blueprint. It adopts a spatial--temporal planner that provides reference guidance toward the goal and threat signals. It then uses a threat-aware handoff to fuse navigation and reflex actions into a nominal command, and a control barrier function shield as a final execution safeguard. We evaluate UEREBot in Isaac Lab simulation and deploy it on a Unitree Go2 quadruped equipped with onboard perception. Across diverse environments with complex static structure and high-speed dynamic obstacles, UEREBot achieves higher avoidance success and more stable locomotion while maintaining goal progress than representative baselines, demonstrating improved safety--progress trade-offs."}

However, in long-horizon tasks, visually similar observations often recur across execution stages while requiring distinct actions, which leads to ambiguous predictions when policies are conditioned only on instantaneous observations, termed multi-modal action ambiguity (MA2). To address this challenge, we propose the Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP), a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework that explicitly conditions action generation on the robot's execution history. TF-DP represents historical motion as an explicit execution trace and projects it into the visual observation space, providing stage-aware context when current observations alone are insufficient. In addition, the induced trace-focused field emphasizes task-relevant regions associated with historical motion, improving robustness to background visual disturbances. We evaluate TF-DP on real-world robotic manipulation tasks exhibiting pronounced multi-modal action ambiguity and visually cluttered conditions. Experimental results show that TF-DP improves temporal consistency and robustness, outperforming the vanilla diffusion policy by 80.56 percent on tasks with multi-modal action ambiguity and by 86.11 percent under visual disturbances, while maintaining inference efficiency with only a 6.4 percent runtime increase. These results demonstrate that execution-trace conditioning offers a scalable and principled approach for robust long-horizon robotic manipulation within a single policy."}

However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it analytically computes the desired robot behavior while simultaneously ''imagining'' the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity and adaptation, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge beyond a threshold. Across seven simulated tasks and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, while offering considerably faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning."}

We present in-parameter structured task reasoning (iSTAR), a framework for enhancing VLA models via functional differentiation induced by in-parameter structural reasoning. Instead of treating VLAs as monolithic policies, iSTAR embeds task-level semantic structure directly into model parameters, enabling differentiated task-level inference without external planners or handcrafted prompt inputs. This injected structure takes the form of implicit dynamic scene-graph knowledge that captures object relations, subtask semantics, and task-level dependencies in parameter space. Across diverse manipulation benchmarks, iSTAR achieves more reliable task decompositions and higher success rates than both in-context and end-to-end VLA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter-space structural reasoning for functional differentiation and improved generalization across task variations."}

A lightweight adapter is then trained to map raw visual-language observations, via a frozen vision-language model, into the expert's latent space, reducing the problem of visuomotor learning to supervised latent alignment rather than end-to-end policy optimization. This decoupling enforces a stable contract between perception and control, enabling expert behavior to be reused across sensing modalities and environmental variations.

A key challenge in this decentralized setting is perceptual misalignment across robots, where viewpoint differences and language ambiguity can yield inconsistent interpretations and degrade cooperative transport. To mitigate this problem, we adopt a dependent leader-follower design, where one robot serves as the leader and the other as the follower. Although such a leader-follower structure appears straightforward, learning with independent and symmetric agents often yields symmetric or unstable behaviors without explicit inductive biases. To address this challenge, we propose Consistent Leader-Follower (CoLF), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for stable leader-follower role differentiation. CoLF consists of two key components: (1) an asymmetric policy design that induces leader-follower role differentiation, and (2) a mutual-information-based training objective that maximizes a variational lower bound, encouraging the follower to predict the leader's action from its local observation. The leader and follower policies are jointly optimized under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to balance task execution and consistent cooperative behaviors.

We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process.

In biplanar X ray guided navigation, such pipelines are widely used due to their real time capability and geometric interpretability. However, navigation reliability can be constrained by an overlooked system level failure mechanism in which installation induced structural perturbations introduced at the perception stage are progressively amplified along the perception reconstruction execution chain and dominate execution level error and tail risk behavior. This paper investigates this mechanism from a system level perspective and presents a unified error propagation modeling framework that characterizes how installation induced structural perturbations propagate and couple with pixel level observation noise through biplanar imaging, projection matrix estimation, triangulation, and coordinate mapping. Using first order analytic uncertainty propagation and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze dominant sensitivity channels and quantify worst case error behavior beyond mean accuracy metrics. The results show that rotational installation error is a primary driver of system level error amplification, while translational misalignment of comparable magnitude plays a secondary role under typical biplanar geometries. Real biplanar X ray bench top experiments further confirm that the predicted amplification trends persist under realistic imaging conditions. These findings reveal a broader structural limitation of reference based multi stage geometric perception pipelines and provide a framework for system level reliability analysis and risk aware design in safety critical robotic navigation systems."}

Factor graphs provide a powerful approach for sensor fusion, enabling the estimation of the maximum a posteriori solution. However, the discrete nature of graph-based representations, combined with asynchronous sensor measurements, complicates consistent state estimation. The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology facilitates graph compression, reducing the number of nodes (optimized variables) by ~30% on average while maintaining map quality at a level comparable to conventional approaches."}

A single penalty parameter controls the coverage-overlap trade-off. We distinguish between a soft regime, which supports multi-objective exploration, and a hard regime, in which the penalty is strong enough to effectively enforce near-disjoint routes. We describe a practical pipeline for generating city instances, constructing candidate routes, building the QUBO matrix, and solving it with an exact mixed-integer solver (Gurobi), simulated annealing, and D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing. Experiments on Barcelona instances with up to 10 000 vehicles reveal a clear coverage-overlap knee and show that Pareto-optimal solutions are mainly obtained under the hard-penalty regime, while D-Wave hybrid solvers and Gurobi achieve essentially identical objective values with only minor differences in runtime as problem size grows."}

We evaluate command center selection across three technology maturity scenarios. Results show transitioning from conservative (1:3 human-robot supervision) to future autonomous operations (1:10) yields significant cost reduction while maintaining complete critical infrastructure coverage. For small problems, exact methods dominate in both cost and computation time; for larger problems, the proposed heuristic achieves feasible solutions in under 3 minutes with approximately 14% optimality gap where comparison is possible.

Although recent works in reinforcement learning have yielded various locomotion strategies, planning over multiple experts remains a complex issue. Existing approaches encounter several constraints: traditional planners are unable to integrate skill-specific policies, whereas hierarchical learning frameworks often lose interpretability and require retraining whenever new policies are added. In this paper, we propose a feasibility-guided planning framework that successfully incorporates multiple terrain-specific policies. Each policy is paired with a Feasibility-Net, which learned to predict feasibility tensors based on the local elevation maps and task vectors. This integration allows classical planning algorithms to derive optimal paths. Through both simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our method efficiently generates reliable plans across diverse and challenging terrains, while consistently aligning with the capabilities of the underlying policies."}

In particular, assessing control algorithms requires an accurate vehicle dynamics simulation. However, recent publications use models with varying levels of detail. This disparity makes it difficult to compare individual control algorithms. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the influence of the fidelity of vehicle dynamics modeling on the closed-loop behavior of trajectory-following controllers. For this purpose, we introduce a comprehensive Autoware-compatible vehicle model. By simplifying this, we derive models with varying fidelity. Evaluating over 550 simulation runs allows us to quantify each model's approximation quality compared to real-world data. Furthermore, we investigate whether the influence of model simplifications changes with varying margins to the acceleration limit of the vehicle. From this, we deduce to which degree a vehicle model can be simplified to evaluate control algorithms depending on the specific application. The real-world data used to validate the simulation environment originate from the Indy Autonomous Challenge race at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in June 2023.

Such interlacing cables create hitches by winding two or more cables around each other, which can enclose payloads or can further develop into knots. Dynamic modeling and control of such hitches is key to mastering the inter-cable manipulation in context of cable-suspended aerial manipulation. This paper introduces an ellipsoid-based kinematic model to connect the geometric nature of a hitch created by two cables and the dynamics of the hitch driven by four aerial vehicles, which reveals the control-affine form of the system. As the constraint for maintaining tension of a cable is also control-affine, we design a quadratic programming-based controller that combines Control Lyapunov and High-Order Control Barrier Functions (CLF-HOCBF-QP) to precisely track a desired hitch position and system shape while enforcing safety constraints like cable tautness. We convert desired geometric reference configurations into target robot positions and introduce a composite error into the Lyapunov function to ensure a relative degree of one to the input.

This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation. We validate R&B-EnCoRe across manipulation (Franka Panda in simulation, WidowX in hardware), legged navigation (bipedal, wheeled, bicycle, quadruped), and autonomous driving embodiments using various VLA architectures with 1B, 4B, 7B, and 30B parameters. Our approach achieves 28% gains in manipulation success, 101% improvement in navigation scores, and 21% reduction in collision-rate metric over models that indiscriminately reason about all available primitives.

To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations. Experiments conducted at real-world construction sites and in indoor office environments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios, achieving efficient and accurate map updates.\\resubmit{Our source code and additional material are available at: https://chamelion-pages.github.io/."}

However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that STEP consistently advances the Pareto frontier of inference latency and success rate over existing methods."}

We present a fully onboard perception-control pipeline for contact-rich AM that achieves accurate motion tracking and regulated contact wrenches without MoCap.

However, existing approaches rely solely on geometric cues, neglect manipulation-relevant semantics, and tend to prioritize exploitation over exploration. To tackle these limitations, we introduce an instance-aware Next Best View (NBV) policy that prioritizes underexplored regions by leveraging object features. Specifically, our object-aware 3DGS distills instancelevel information into one-hot object vectors, which are used to compute confidence-weighted information gain that guides the identification of regions associated with erroneous and uncertain Gaussians. Furthermore, our method can be easily adapted to an object-centric NBV, which focuses view selection on a target object, thereby improving reconstruction robustness to object placement. Experiments demonstrate that our NBV policy reduces depth error by up to 77.14% on the synthetic dataset and 34.10% on the real-world GraspNet dataset compared to baselines. Moreover, compared to targeting the entire scene, performing NBV on a specific object yields an additional reduction of 25.60% in depth error for that object. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world robotic manipulation tasks."}

We demonstrate ReefFlex increases both grasp success and grasp quality (disturbance resistance, positioning accuracy) and reduces in adverse events encountered during coral manipulation compared to reference designs. ReefFlex, offers a generalisable method to design soft end-effectors for complex handling and paves a pathway towards automation in previously unachievable domains like coral handling for restoration."}

Specifically, the questionnaire considers various interaction-relevant factors, including the surrounding vehicle's size, speed, position, and maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, as well as the maneuvers of the ego vehicle. The response indicates the user-preferred clearance for the scenario defined by the question and is incorporated as constraints in the optimal control problem.

To overcome this limitation, we approximate the original problem by decomposing it into multiple subproblems, each dealing with one fixed scenario. We then solve these subproblems in parallel and select one using the cost function from the original problem.

Such priors can be constructed from heterogeneous sources commonly available in practice, including polygon outlines vectorized from occupancy/grid maps and CAD/model/floor-plan layouts. For each incoming LiDAR scan, Graph-Loc extracts sparse point and line primitives to form an observation graph, retrieves a pose-conditioned visible subgraph via LiDAR ray simulation, and performs scan-to-map association through unbalanced optimal transport with a local graph-context regularizer. The unbalanced formulation relaxes mass conservation, improving robustness to missing, spurious, and fragmented structures under occlusion. To enhance stability in low-observability segments, we estimate information anisotropy from the refinement normal matrix and defer updates along weakly constrained directions until sufficient constraints reappear.

In addition, we propose a decentralized multi-robot infrastructure based on Hyperledger Fabric that can host the proposed oracle. The proposed infrastructure enables users to express their natural language intent to the system, which then can be decomposed into subtasks. These subtasks require coordinating different robots from different vendors, while enforcing fine-grained access control management on the data. To evaluate our methodology, we created the SkillChain-RTD benchmark made it publicly available. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, and the proposed aggregation method outperforms other aggregation methods currently in use."}

While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery.

While recent advances in pose estimation have significantly improved numerical accuracy, practical robotic systems still suffer from frequent execution failures even when pose estimates appear accurate. This gap suggests that pose accuracy alone is insufficient to guarantee execution-level reliability. In this paper, we reveal that such failures arise from a deterministic geometric error amplification mechanism, in which small pose estimation errors are magnified through system structure and motion execution, leading to unstable or failed alignment. Rather than modifying pose estimation algorithms, we propose a Reliability-aware Execution Gating mechanism that operates at the execution level. The proposed approach evaluates geometric consistency and configuration risk before execution, and selectively rejects or scales high-risk pose updates. We validate the proposed method on a real UR5 robotic platform performing single-step visual alignment tasks under varying camera-target distances and off-axis configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed execution gating significantly improves task success rates, reduces execution variance, and suppresses tail-risk behavior, while leaving average pose accuracy largely unchanged. Importantly, the proposed mechanism is estimator-agnostic and can be readily integrated with both classical geometry-based and learning-based pose estimation pipelines. These results highlight the importance of execution-level reliability modeling and provide a practical solution for improving robustness in near-field vision-guided robotic systems."}

We propose UniPlan, a vision-language task planning system for long-horizon mobile-manipulation in large-scale indoor environments, that unifies scene topology, visuals, and robot capabilities into a holistic PDDL representation. UniPlan programmatically extends learned tabletop domains from UniDomain to support navigation, door traversal, and bimanual coordination. It operates on a visual-topological map, comprising navigation landmarks anchored with scene images. Given a language instruction, UniPlan retrieves task-relevant nodes from the map and uses a VLM to ground the anchored image into task-relevant objects and their PDDL states; next, it reconnects these nodes to a compressed, densely-connected topological map, also represented in PDDL, with connectivity and costs derived from the original map; Finally, a mobile-manipulation plan is generated using off-the-shelf PDDL solvers.

Our approach is based on the idea of a lower-dimensional manifold of feasible, likely-visited states during such manipulation and to guide RL with a sampler from this manifold. We propose Sample-Guided RL, which uses model-based constraint solvers to efficiently sample feasible configurations (satisfying differentiable collision, contact, and force constraints) and leverage them to guide RL for universal (goal-conditioned) manipulation policies. We study using this data directly to bias state visitation, as well as using black-box optimization of open-loop trajectories between random configurations to impose a state bias and optionally add a behavior cloning loss. In a minimalistic double sphere manipulation setting, Sample-Guided RL discovers complex manipulation strategies and achieves high success rates in reaching any statically stable state. In a more challenging panda arm setting, our approach achieves a significant success rate over a near-zero baseline, and demonstrates a breadth of complex whole-body-contact manipulation strategies."}

We argue this stems from mimicking raw trajectories without understanding the underlying intent. To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \\textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \\textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \\textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \\textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \\textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \\textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \\textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process. Experiments on several manipulation benchmarks and on a real robot demonstrate state-of-the-art success rates, superior inference efficiency, robust generalization against disturbances, and effective one-shot transfer."}

Standard Behavior Cloning (BC), by mimicking the robot's executed trajectory, fundamentally ignores this compensatory mechanism. In this work, we propose a Dual-State Conditioning framework that shifts the learning objective to \"Intent Cloning\" (master command). We posit that the Intent-Execution Mismatch, the discrepancy between master command and slave response, is not noise, but a critical signal that physically encodes implicit interaction forces and algorithmically reveals the operator's strategy for overcoming system dynamics. By predicting the master intent, our policy learns to generate a \"virtual equilibrium point\", effectively realizing implicit impedance control. Furthermore, by explicitly conditioning on the history of this mismatch, the model performs implicit system identification, perceiving tracking errors as external forces to close the control loop. To bridge the temporal gap caused by inference latency, we further formulate the policy as a trajectory inpainter to ensure continuous control. We validate our approach on a sensorless, low-cost bi-manual setup. Empirical results across tasks requiring contact-rich manipulation and dynamic tracking reveal a decisive gap: while standard execution-cloning fails due to the inability to overcome contact stiffness and tracking lag, our mismatch-aware approach achieves robust success.

To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV.

One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work.

Experiments in four social navigation contexts demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance with the lowest personal space violation duration, the minimal pedestrian-facing time, and no social zone intrusions.

Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced. Project page: https://cap-policy.github.io/"}

We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\\rightarrow$ urban and day $\\rightarrow$ night ($\\sim 31\\%$ each); actor swaps $\\sim 10\\%$, moderate rain $\\sim 7\\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\\% \\rightarrow 70.1\\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies."}

However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $χ_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $χ_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that $χ_{0}$ surpasses the state-of-the-art $π_{0.5}$ in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs. Code, data and models will be released to facilitate the community."}

While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks."}
