### [1] [Inference of Human-derived Specifications of Object Placement via Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19367)
*Alex Cuellar,Ho Chit Siu,Julie A Shah*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了PARCC框架，基于区域连接演算(RCC)的形式化逻辑系统，用于描述物体间的空间相对位置关系，并通过演示学习算法来推断人类可接受的物体配置规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人操作能力在拾取放置任务中有所提升，但理解人类可接受的物体配置方法在表达空间关系方面仍然有限，需要更好地捕捉对人类重要的空间关系规则。

Method: 开发了positionally-augmented RCC (PARCC)形式化逻辑框架，基于区域连接演算，并设计了通过演示学习PARCC规范的推理算法。

Result: 人类研究结果表明，该框架能够有效捕捉人类的意图规范，且演示学习方法优于人类直接提供的规范说明。

Conclusion: PARCC框架为机器人理解人类物体排列规则提供了有效的形式化工具，演示学习方法在获取人类空间关系偏好方面表现出优越性。

Abstract: As robots' manipulation capabilities improve for pick-and-place tasks (e.g.,
object packing, sorting, and kitting), methods focused on understanding
human-acceptable object configurations remain limited expressively with regard
to capturing spatial relationships important to humans. To advance robotic
understanding of human rules for object arrangement, we introduce
positionally-augmented RCC (PARCC), a formal logic framework based on region
connection calculus (RCC) for describing the relative position of objects in
space. Additionally, we introduce an inference algorithm for learning PARCC
specifications via demonstrations. Finally, we present the results from a human
study, which demonstrate our framework's ability to capture a human's intended
specification and the benefits of learning from demonstration approaches over
human-provided specifications.

### [2] [FlipWalker: Jacob's Ladder toy-inspired robot for locomotion across diverse, complex terrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19380)
*Diancheng Li,Nia Ralston,Bastiaan Hagen,Phoebe Tan,Matthew A. Robertson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlipWalker是一种受雅各布天梯玩具启发的欠驱动机器人系统，通过翻转运动在复杂地形中移动，比轮式机器人更具优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮式机器人在不规则户外地形中表现不佳，需要一种新的运动策略来应对草地、岩石和雪地等挑战性环境

Method: 采用两段式结构通过柔性电缆连接，模仿雅各布天梯玩具的级联运动。每个段内的电机驱动腿根据配置推动地面或相对段，基于物理模型设计翻转动力学

Result: 原型机重0.78kg，最大翻转速度达0.2体长/秒，在人工草地、河石和雪地等不同地形上成功验证了运动性能

Conclusion: FlipWalker的翻转策略依靠垂直于表面的地面反作用力，为不规则户外地形的导航提供了有前景的传统运动替代方案

Abstract: This paper introduces FlipWalker, a novel underactuated robot locomotion
system inspired by Jacob's Ladder illusion toy, designed to traverse
challenging terrains where wheeled robots often struggle. Like the Jacob's
Ladder toy, FlipWalker features two interconnected segments joined by flexible
cables, enabling it to pivot and flip around singularities in a manner
reminiscent of the toy's cascading motion. Actuation is provided by
motor-driven legs within each segment that push off either the ground or the
opposing segment, depending on the robot's current configuration. A
physics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to
elucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle
clearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a
maximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second. Experimental trials on
artificial grass, river rocks, and snow demonstrate that FlipWalker's flipping
strategy, which relies on ground reaction forces applied normal to the surface,
offers a promising alternative to traditional locomotion for navigating
irregular outdoor terrain.

### [3] [LaVA-Man: Learning Visual Action Representations for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19391)
*Chaoran Zhu,Hengyi Wang,Yik Lung Pang,Changjae Oh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过自监督预训练任务学习视觉-文本关联的方法，通过重构被遮挡的目标图像来学习视觉-动作表示，无需机器人动作监督，然后在少量演示样本上微调用于操作任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的两步方法（先编码视觉观察和文本指令的相似度，再映射到机器人动作）限制了模型捕捉视觉观察和文本指令之间的关系，导致操作任务精度降低。

Method: 使用自监督预训练任务：基于输入图像和文本指令重构被遮挡的目标图像，学习视觉-文本关联。然后使用少量演示样本对学习到的表示进行微调用于操作任务。

Result: 在五个基准测试（包括仿真和真实机器人验证）上，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过自监督预训练学习视觉-文本关联的方法有效提升了语言引导机器人操作的性能，且只需少量演示样本即可微调用于具体任务。

Abstract: Visual-textual understanding is essential for language-guided robot
manipulation. Recent works leverage pre-trained vision-language models to
measure the similarity between encoded visual observations and textual
instructions, and then train a model to map this similarity to robot actions.
However, this two-step approach limits the model to capture the relationship
between visual observations and textual instructions, leading to reduced
precision in manipulation tasks. We propose to learn visual-textual
associations through a self-supervised pretext task: reconstructing a masked
goal image conditioned on an input image and textual instructions. This
formulation allows the model to learn visual-action representations without
robot action supervision. The learned representations can then be fine-tuned
for manipulation tasks with only a few demonstrations. We also introduce the
\textit{Omni-Object Pick-and-Place} dataset, which consists of annotated robot
tabletop manipulation episodes, including 180 object classes and 3,200
instances with corresponding textual instructions. This dataset enables the
model to acquire diverse object priors and allows for a more comprehensive
evaluation of its generalisation capability across object instances.
Experimental results on the five benchmarks, including both simulated and
real-robot validations, demonstrate that our method outperforms prior art.

### [4] [From Stoplights to On-Ramps: A Comprehensive Set of Crash Rate Benchmarks for Freeway and Surface Street ADS Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19425)
*John M. Scanlon,Timothy L McMurry,Yin-Hsiu Chen,Kristofer D. Kusano,Trent Victor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了美国自动驾驶系统(ADS)的出突率基准，特别关注高速公路出突风险评估，发现不同地区存在显著差异，并量化了评估ADS安全性所需的量产量要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展以前仅聚焦城市道路的出突率基准，需要包含高速公路出突风险评估，以更全面地评估自动驾驶系统的安全性能。

Method: 利用公开的警察报告出突数据和车辆行驶里程(VMT)数据，进行在运客车分离、路网类型分类和出突类型分析。

Result: 发现高速公路出突率存在显著地域差异，亚特兰大与凤凰城的伤害出突率相差3.5倍；不同严重程度出突的类型分布不同，低严重性能无法预测高严重性能。

Conclusion: 需要基于具体位置的基准来避免偏差的安全性评估，本研究提供了首个高速公路特定的ADS评估基准框架，为开发者和评估者提供了基础支持。

Abstract: This paper presents crash rate benchmarks for evaluating US-based Automated
Driving Systems (ADS) for multiple urban areas. The purpose of this study was
to extend prior benchmarks focused only on surface streets to additionally
capture freeway crash risk for future ADS safety performance assessments. Using
publicly available police-reported crash and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data,
the methodology details the isolation of in-transport passenger vehicles, road
type classification, and crash typology. Key findings revealed that freeway
crash rates exhibit large geographic dependence variations with
any-injury-reported crash rates being nearly 3.5 times higher in Atlanta (2.4
IPMM; the highest) when compared to Phoenix (0.7 IPMM; the lowest). The results
show the critical need for location-specific benchmarks to avoid biased safety
evaluations and provide insights into the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) required
to achieve statistical significance for various safety impact levels. The
distribution of crash types depended on the outcome severity level. Higher
severity outcomes (e.g., fatal crashes) had a larger proportion of
single-vehicle, vulnerable road users (VRU), and opposite-direction collisions
compared to lower severity (police-reported) crashes. Given heterogeneity in
crash types by severity, performance in low-severity scenarios may not be
predictive of high-severity outcomes. These benchmarks are additionally used to
quantify at the required mileage to show statistically significant deviations
from human performance. This is the first paper to generate freeway-specific
benchmarks for ADS evaluation and provides a foundational framework for future
ADS benchmarking by evaluators and developers.

### [5] [An Iterative Approach for Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Route Planning with Resource Transportation Uncertainty and Temporal Logic Goals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19429)
*Gustavo A. Cardona,Kaier Liang,Cristian-Ioan Vasile*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种迭代方法用于未知资源分布环境中的异构多智能体路径规划，通过动态平衡探索和任务执行来处理资源不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构机器人团队在未知资源分布环境中执行复杂任务时的规划挑战，特别是处理资源初始分布和数量的不确定性。

Method: 使用基于信号时序逻辑的能力时序逻辑(CaTL)来规范任务，开发迭代算法动态平衡环境探索和任务完成，机器人根据当前信息逐步完善对资源环境的理解并调整策略。

Result: 通过模拟案例研究证明了方法的有效性和性能，能够在动态资源受限环境中实现异构团队的高效协调。

Conclusion: 该方法为不确定条件下的异构多智能体规划提供了鲁棒解决方案，能够有效处理资源不确定性并实现任务目标的最大化满足。

Abstract: This paper presents an iterative approach for heterogeneous multi-agent route
planning in environments with unknown resource distributions. We focus on a
team of robots with diverse capabilities tasked with executing missions
specified using Capability Temporal Logic (CaTL), a formal framework built on
Signal Temporal Logic to handle spatial, temporal, capability, and resource
constraints. The key challenge arises from the uncertainty in the initial
distribution and quantity of resources in the environment. To address this, we
introduce an iterative algorithm that dynamically balances exploration and task
fulfillment. Robots are guided to explore the environment, identifying resource
locations and quantities while progressively refining their understanding of
the resource landscape. At the same time, they aim to maximally satisfy the
mission objectives based on the current information, adapting their strategies
as new data is uncovered. This approach provides a robust solution for planning
in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient coordination
of heterogeneous teams even under conditions of uncertainty. Our method's
effectiveness and performance are demonstrated through simulated case studies.

### [6] [Gentle Object Retraction in Dense Clutter Using Multimodal Force Sensing and Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19476)
*Dane Brouwer,Joshua Citron,Heather Nolte,Jeannette Bohg,Mark Cutkosky*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探索了非抓取触觉传感在机器人从密集物体集合中安全提取物体的作用，通过模仿学习训练策略，发现力传感显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常空间中密集可移动物体集合很常见，机器人安全提取这些物体很困难，而人类通过手和手臂的非抓取触觉传感能轻松完成

Method: 使用模仿学习从随机生成场景的演示中训练策略，对比五种传感模态：手眼视觉、本体感觉、三轴触觉传感、关节力矩估计的接触力矩、真空吸盘成功获取物体的测量

Result: 使用任何力传感的策略都表现出更少的过度力失败、更高的总体成功率和更快的完成时间。同时使用触觉和力矩信息获得最佳性能，比无力信息基线提升80%

Conclusion: 非抓取触觉传感对于机器人安全地从受限杂乱环境中提取物体至关重要，力传感信息显著改善了机器人操作的性能和安全性

Abstract: Dense collections of movable objects are common in everyday spaces -- from
cabinets in a home to shelves in a warehouse. Safely retracting objects from
such collections is difficult for robots, yet people do it easily, using
non-prehensile tactile sensing on the sides and backs of their hands and arms.
We investigate the role of such sensing for training robots to gently reach
into constrained clutter and extract objects. The available sensing modalities
are (1) "eye-in-hand" vision, (2) proprioception, (3) non-prehensile triaxial
tactile sensing, (4) contact wrenches estimated from joint torques, and (5) a
measure of successful object acquisition obtained by monitoring the vacuum line
of a suction cup. We use imitation learning to train policies from a set of
demonstrations on randomly generated scenes, then conduct an ablation study of
wrench and tactile information. We evaluate each policy's performance across 40
unseen environment configurations. Policies employing any force sensing show
fewer excessive force failures, an increased overall success rate, and faster
completion times. The best performance is achieved using both tactile and
wrench information, producing an 80% improvement above the baseline without
force information.

### [7] [DATR: Diffusion-based 3D Apple Tree Reconstruction Framework with Sparse-View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19508)
*Tian Qiu,Alan Zoubi,Yiyuan Lin,Ruiming Du,Lailiang Cheng,Yu Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出DATR两阶段框架，通过扩散模型和大型重建模型从稀疏视图重建苹果树3D模型，在真实和合成数据集上均优于现有方法，吞吐量提升360倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生应用需要高精度3D重建，但现有方法在野外稀疏和遮挡视图条件下表现不佳，特别是针对苹果树等复杂农业场景

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用机载传感器和基础模型半自动生成树掩码；第二阶段使用扩散模型生成多视图，大型重建模型生成隐式神经场，基于Real2Sim生成器合成的逼真苹果树数据进行训练

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上均优于现有3D重建方法，域特征估计达到工业级固定激光扫描仪水平，吞吐量提升约360倍

Conclusion: DATR框架展示了可扩展农业数字孪生系统的强大潜力，能够从稀疏视图实现高质量的苹果树3D重建

Abstract: Digital twin applications offered transformative potential by enabling
real-time monitoring and robotic simulation through accurate virtual replicas
of physical assets. The key to these systems is 3D reconstruction with high
geometrical fidelity. However, existing methods struggled under field
conditions, especially with sparse and occluded views. This study developed a
two-stage framework (DATR) for the reconstruction of apple trees from sparse
views. The first stage leverages onboard sensors and foundation models to
semi-automatically generate tree masks from complex field images. Tree masks
are used to filter out background information in multi-modal data for the
single-image-to-3D reconstruction at the second stage. This stage consists of a
diffusion model and a large reconstruction model for respective multi view and
implicit neural field generation. The training of the diffusion model and LRM
was achieved by using realistic synthetic apple trees generated by a Real2Sim
data generator. The framework was evaluated on both field and synthetic
datasets. The field dataset includes six apple trees with field-measured ground
truth, while the synthetic dataset featured structurally diverse trees.
Evaluation results showed that our DATR framework outperformed existing 3D
reconstruction methods across both datasets and achieved domain-trait
estimation comparable to industrial-grade stationary laser scanners while
improving the throughput by $\sim$360 times, demonstrating strong potential for
scalable agricultural digital twin systems.

### [8] [A Lightweight Crowd Model for Robot Social Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19595)
*Maryam Kazemi Eskeri,Thomas Wiedemann,Ville Kyrki,Dominik Baumann,Tomasz Piotr Kucner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的实时宏观流动预测模型，用于人群运动预测，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升计算效率，从而支持机器人在密集环境中的社交式导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微观模型在密集人群中计算成本高，而现有宏观模型要么过于简单要么计算量大，需要找到预测准确性和计算效率之间的平衡。

Method: 基于行人流的内在特性，简化空间和时间处理，设计了一种轻量级实时宏观人群预测模型，无需复杂的架构即可实现稳健的泛化能力。

Result: 模型实现了推理时间减少3.6倍，同时预测准确性提高3.1%，集成到社交式规划框架后，能够支持机器人在动态环境中高效且社交合规的导航。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明，通过高效的人群建模技术，机器人可以在不需要高成本计算的情况下完成密集环境中的导航任务。

Abstract: Robots operating in human-populated environments must navigate safely and
efficiently while minimizing social disruption. Achieving this requires
estimating crowd movement to avoid congested areas in real-time. Traditional
microscopic models struggle to scale in dense crowds due to high computational
cost, while existing macroscopic crowd prediction models tend to be either
overly simplistic or computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a
lightweight, real-time macroscopic crowd prediction model tailored for human
motion, which balances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Our
approach simplifies both spatial and temporal processing based on the inherent
characteristics of pedestrian flow, enabling robust generalization without the
overhead of complex architectures. We demonstrate a 3.6 times reduction in
inference time, while improving prediction accuracy by 3.1 %. Integrated into a
socially aware planning framework, the model enables efficient and socially
compliant robot navigation in dynamic environments. This work highlights that
efficient human crowd modeling enables robots to navigate dense environments
without costly computations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决序列接触任务中机器人操作的效率和适应性挑战，需要开发能够动态调整刚度并有效探索接触行为的控制框架。

Method: 采用层次强化学习结构，包含三个关键组件：支持可变刚度控制的动作空间、自适应刚度控制器、以及用于高效探索的仿射耦合机制。

Conclusion: 该框架为更自适应和通用的机器人操作系统奠定了基础，在复杂接触任务中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents an Impedance Primitive-augmented hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework for efficient robotic manipulation in
sequential contact tasks. We leverage this hierarchical structure to
sequentially execute behavior primitives with variable stiffness control
capabilities for contact tasks. Our proposed approach relies on three key
components: an action space enabling variable stiffness control, an adaptive
stiffness controller for dynamic stiffness adjustments during primitive
execution, and affordance coupling for efficient exploration while encouraging
compliance. Through comprehensive training and evaluation, our framework learns
efficient stiffness control capabilities and demonstrates improvements in
learning efficiency, compositionality in primitive selection, and success rates
compared to the state-of-the-art. The training environments include block
lifting, door opening, object pushing, and surface cleaning. Real world
evaluations further confirm the framework's sim2real capability. This work lays
the foundation for more adaptive and versatile robotic manipulation systems,
with potential applications in more complex contact-based tasks.

*Dongjae Lee,Byeongjun Kim,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于多旋翼的空中操作器只能在小角度操作，本文提出了一种全向空中操作器的几何稳定控制和全身运动规划框架，能够在任意6D姿态空中想停并执行复杂操作任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多旋翼基础的空中操作器因为基底的不充分驱动性，只能在小角度的滚转和俯仰角度下进行操作，限制了工作空间和任务能力。如果能够在任意方位空中想停，将大大扩展操作能力。

Method: 首先提出了一种基于浮动基底的几何稳定控制器，能够应对机械手臂运动和交互力的影响。然后设计了一个两步优化的全身运动规划器，统筹考虑浮动基底的姿态和机械手关节角度，以利用整个配置空间。

Result: 该方法能够使基底在任意6D姿态下稳定停泊，并在避免碰撞的情况下自主执行复杂操作。通过实验验证，空中操作器能够在近90度甚至180度俯仰角度的场景中成功执行抓取和拉勘任务。

Conclusion: 本文提出的全向空中操作器控制和规划框架有效扩展了空中操作的工作空间和能力，能够在极端姿态下完成之前无法实现的操作任务，为空中操作领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Aerial manipulators based on conventional multirotors can conduct
manipulation only in small roll and pitch angles due to the underactuatedness
of the multirotor base. If the multirotor base is capable of hovering at
arbitrary orientation, the robot can freely locate itself at any point in
$\mathsf{SE}(3)$, significantly extending its manipulation workspace and
enabling a manipulation task that was originally not viable. In this work, we
present a geometric robust control and whole-body motion planning framework for
an omnidirectional aerial manipulator (OAM). To maximize the strength of OAM,
we first propose a geometric robust controller for a floating base. Since the
motion of the robotic arm and the interaction forces during manipulation affect
the stability of the floating base, the base should be capable of mitigating
these adverse effects while controlling its 6D pose. We then design a two-step
optimization-based whole-body motion planner, jointly considering the pose of
the floating base and the joint angles of the robotic arm to harness the entire
configuration space. The devised two-step approach facilitates real-time
applicability and enhances convergence of the optimization problem with
non-convex and non-Euclidean search space. The proposed approach enables the
base to be stationary at any 6D pose while autonomously carrying out
sophisticated manipulation near obstacles without any collision. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework through experiments in which an OAM
performs grasping and pulling of an object in multiple scenarios, including
near $90^\circ$ and even $180^\circ$ pitch angles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Floaty是一种形状可变机器人，通过模仿鸟类的智能形态控制被动利用风能，在10m/s垂直气流中实现悬停和机动，能耗比推进器系统低一个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决空中机器人同时实现敏捷机动性和高能效的挑战，特别是在动态风环境中。传统推进器系统能耗高，固定翼设计缺乏悬停能力。

Method: 采用形状变化设计，通过实验学习的气动模型进行智能形态控制，实现被动稳定性和精确姿态位置控制，无需主动推进。

Result: 风洞实验显示Floaty能在10m/s垂直气流中悬停、机动和抗干扰，比功率消耗仅为10W/kg，比推进器系统低一个数量级。

Conclusion: Floaty引入了能效空中机器人的新范式，利用形态智能和控制技术在挑战性风条件下可持续运行。

Abstract: Achieving both agile maneuverability and high energy efficiency in aerial
robots, particularly in dynamic wind environments, remains challenging.
Conventional thruster-powered systems offer agility but suffer from high energy
consumption, while fixed-wing designs are efficient but lack hovering and
maneuvering capabilities. We present Floaty, a shape-changing robot that
overcomes these limitations by passively soaring, harnessing wind energy
through intelligent morphological control inspired by birds. Floaty's design is
optimized for passive stability, and its control policy is derived from an
experimentally learned aerodynamic model, enabling precise attitude and
position control without active propulsion. Wind tunnel experiments demonstrate
Floaty's ability to hover, maneuver, and reject disturbances in vertical
airflows up to 10 m/s. Crucially, Floaty achieves this with a specific power
consumption of 10 W/kg, an order of magnitude lower than thruster-powered
systems. This introduces a paradigm for energy-efficient aerial robotics,
leveraging morphological intelligence and control to operate sustainably in
challenging wind conditions.

### [12] [Efficient Human-Aware Task Allocation for Multi-Robot Systems in Shared Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19731)
*Maryam Kazemi Eskeri,Ville Kyrki,Dominik Baumann,Tomasz Piotr Kucner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑人类动态的多机器人任务分配方法，利用动态地图(MoDs)来预测人类移动对任务执行时间的影响，显著提高了多机器人系统在共享环境中的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多机器人任务分配(MRTA)方法大多忽略人类动态，仅依赖静态地图，导致在共享环境中效率低下和延迟。人类移动模式对任务执行时间有显著影响，需要动态感知的分配策略。

Method: 提出了基于动态地图(MoDs)的方法，MoDs是可查询时空历史人类移动模式的模型。使用包含MoDs的随机成本函数来估计人类对任务执行时间的影响，从而优化任务分配。

Result: 实验结果显示，集成MoDs的方法相比动态无关方法减少了高达26%的任务完成时间，相比基线方法减少了高达19%的任务完成时间。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在共享环境的多机器人任务分配中考虑人类动态的重要性，为在人类密集环境中部署多机器人系统提供了高效框架。

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are increasingly deployed in applications, such as
intralogistics or autonomous delivery, where multiple robots collaborate to
complete tasks efficiently. One of the key factors enabling their efficient
cooperation is Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA). Algorithms solving this
problem optimize task distribution among robots to minimize the overall
execution time. In shared environments, apart from the relative distance
between the robots and the tasks, the execution time is also significantly
impacted by the delay caused by navigating around moving people. However, most
existing MRTA approaches are dynamics-agnostic, relying on static maps and
neglecting human motion patterns, leading to inefficiencies and delays. In this
paper, we introduce \acrfull{method name}. This method leverages Maps of
Dynamics (MoDs), spatio-temporal queryable models designed to capture
historical human movement patterns, to estimate the impact of humans on the
task execution time during deployment. \acrshort{method name} utilizes a
stochastic cost function that includes MoDs. Experimental results show that
integrating MoDs enhances task allocation performance, resulting in reduced
mission completion times by up to $26\%$ compared to the dynamics-agnostic
method and up to $19\%$ compared to the baseline. This work underscores the
importance of considering human dynamics in MRTA within shared environments and
presents an efficient framework for deploying multi-robot systems in
environments populated by humans.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FDIT*是一种基于采样的路径规划算法，通过利用无效顶点信息和库仑定律物理原理，在EIT*基础上改进搜索效率和解成本，在高维空间中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维运动规划中的挑战，利用传统规划器中常被忽视的无效顶点信息，结合物理力原理来提高路径规划的效率和成本效益。

Method: 基于EIT*算法，引入库仑定律物理原理，提出椭圆k近邻搜索方法，通过力方向引导搜索区域，利用无效顶点数据改进搜索策略。

Result: 在R^4到R^16的高维环境中，FDIT*在搜索效率和路径成本方面优于现有的单查询采样规划器，并在真实移动操作任务中得到验证。

Conclusion: FDIT*通过融合无效顶点信息和物理动力学原理，实现了更快的收敛速度和更优的路径成本，特别适用于受限高维环境中的路径规划问题。

Abstract: Path planning has long been an important and active research area in
robotics. To address challenges in high-dimensional motion planning, this study
introduces the Force Direction Informed Trees (FDIT*), a sampling-based planner
designed to enhance speed and cost-effectiveness in pathfinding. FDIT* builds
upon the state-of-the-art informed sampling planner, the Effort Informed Trees
(EIT*), by capitalizing on often-overlooked information in invalid vertices. It
incorporates principles of physical force, particularly Coulomb's law. This
approach proposes the elliptical $k$-nearest neighbors search method, enabling
fast convergence navigation and avoiding high solution cost or infeasible paths
by exploring more problem-specific search-worthy areas. It demonstrates
benefits in search efficiency and cost reduction, particularly in confined,
high-dimensional environments. It can be viewed as an extension of nearest
neighbors search techniques. Fusing invalid vertex data with physical dynamics
facilitates force-direction-based search regions, resulting in an improved
convergence rate to the optimum. FDIT* outperforms existing single-query,
sampling-based planners on the tested problems in R^4 to R^16 and has been
demonstrated on a real-world mobile manipulation task.

TL;DR: G3T*是一种新颖的双向运动规划算法，通过贪婪嫁接无效边连接来重建树连接性，实现快速路径收敛和渐近最优性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统双向运动规划中，前向和反向搜索树的连接可能失败，导致需要重启非对称双向搜索，限制了规划效率

Method: 采用贪婪方法，使用GuILD子集的最小Lebesgue测度来优化路径，动态调整采样分布，嫁接无效边连接以重建树连接性

Result: 在R^2到R^8维度的基准实验和真实机器人评估中，G3T*相比现有单查询采样规划器表现出更优越的性能

Conclusion: G3T*通过创新的嫁接机制和动态采样策略，显著提高了双向运动规划的收敛速度和解决方案质量

Abstract: Bidirectional motion planning often reduces planning time compared to its
unidirectional counterparts. It requires connecting the forward and reverse
search trees to form a continuous path. However, this process could fail and
restart the asymmetric bidirectional search due to the limitations of
lazy-reverse search. To address this challenge, we propose Greedy GuILD
Grafting Trees (G3T*), a novel path planner that grafts invalid edge
connections at both ends to re-establish tree-based connectivity, enabling
rapid path convergence. G3T* employs a greedy approach using the minimum
Lebesgue measure of guided incremental local densification (GuILD) subsets to
optimize paths efficiently. Furthermore, G3T* dynamically adjusts the sampling
distribution between the informed set and GuILD subsets based on historical and
current cost improvements, ensuring asymptotic optimality. These features
enhance the forward search's growth towards the reverse tree, achieving faster
convergence and lower solution costs. Benchmark experiments across dimensions
from R^2 to R^8 and real-world robotic evaluations demonstrate G3T*'s superior
performance compared to existing single-query sampling-based planners. A video

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义图传播算法的室内场景事故风险区域估计框架，通过对象级风险评估和上下文传播来提升服务机器人的风险感知能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人融入日常生活，特别是在家庭环境中，预测和应对环境风险对于确保用户安全、信任和有效人机交互至关重要

Method: 采用语义图传播算法，将每个对象表示为带有风险分数的节点，基于空间邻近性和事故关系进行不对称风险传播

Result: 在人工标注风险区域数据集上验证，二元风险检测准确率达到75%，在涉及尖锐或不稳定物体的场景中与人类感知高度一致

Conclusion: 该框架展示了上下文感知风险推理在增强机器人场景理解和主动安全行为方面的潜力，可为未来实时警报和自主避险系统奠定基础

Abstract: We present a novel framework for estimating accident-prone regions in
everyday indoor scenes, aimed at improving real-time risk awareness in service
robots operating in human-centric environments. As robots become integrated
into daily life, particularly in homes, the ability to anticipate and respond
to environmental hazards is crucial for ensuring user safety, trust, and
effective human-robot interaction. Our approach models object-level risk and
context through a semantic graph-based propagation algorithm. Each object is
represented as a node with an associated risk score, and risk propagates
asymmetrically from high-risk to low-risk objects based on spatial proximity
and accident relationship. This enables the robot to infer potential hazards
even when they are not explicitly visible or labeled. Designed for
interpretability and lightweight onboard deployment, our method is validated on
a dataset with human-annotated risk regions, achieving a binary risk detection
accuracy of 75%. The system demonstrates strong alignment with human
perception, particularly in scenes involving sharp or unstable objects. These
results underline the potential of context-aware risk reasoning to enhance
robotic scene understanding and proactive safety behaviors in shared
human-robot spaces. This framework could serve as a foundation for future
systems that make context-driven safety decisions, provide real-time alerts, or
autonomously assist users in avoiding or mitigating hazards within home
environments.

TL;DR: APT*是一种新型采样运动规划器，通过自适应批量大小和椭圆最近邻模块动态调整路径搜索过程，在4-16维空间中优于现有单查询采样规划器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径规划方法通常使用固定批量大小且忽略障碍物信息，缺乏问题特异性，需要更智能的自适应规划方法

Method: 扩展FDIT*算法，集成自适应批量调整和椭圆r最近邻模块，将顶点视为遵循库仑定律的电荷来定义虚拟力，使用非线性方法自适应调整电荷

Result: APT*在R4到R16维度空间中优于现有单查询采样规划器，收敛速度更快且解成本更低，并在真实机器人操作任务中得到验证

Conclusion: APT*通过自适应机制和环境反馈显著提升了路径规划性能，为高维运动规划提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Optimal path planning aims to determine a sequence of states from a start to
a goal while accounting for planning objectives. Popular methods often
integrate fixed batch sizes and neglect information on obstacles, which is not
problem-specific. This study introduces Adaptively Prolated Trees (APT*), a
novel sampling-based motion planner that extends based on Force Direction
Informed Trees (FDIT*), integrating adaptive batch-sizing and elliptical
$r$-nearest neighbor modules to dynamically modulate the path searching process
based on environmental feedback. APT* adjusts batch sizes based on the
hypervolume of the informed sets and considers vertices as electric charges
that obey Coulomb's law to define virtual forces via neighbor samples, thereby
refining the prolate nearest neighbor selection. These modules employ
non-linear prolate methods to adaptively adjust the electric charges of
vertices for force definition, thereby improving the convergence rate with
lower solution costs. Comparative analyses show that APT* outperforms existing
single-query sampling-based planners in dimensions from $\mathbb{R}^4$ to
$\mathbb{R}^{16}$, and it was further validated through a real-world robot
manipulation task. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at:

comparisons to other methods to validate our design criteria and demonstrate
the advantages of our contribution.

TL;DR: FARM框架通过帧加速增强和残差专家混合方法，显著提升了人形控制器在爆炸性动作上的表现，同时保持日常动作的精确跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人形控制器在温和的日常动作上表现良好，但在爆炸性动作上容易失败，这限制了实际应用。需要一种能够统一处理不同动态范围动作的解决方案。

Method: FARM框架包含三个核心组件：1) 帧加速增强 - 通过扩大帧间间隔让模型接触高速姿态变化；2) 鲁棒基础控制器 - 可靠跟踪日常低动态动作；3) 残差专家混合(MoE) - 自适应分配额外网络容量处理高动态挑战性动作。

Result: 在HDHM数据集上，FARM将跟踪失败率降低了42.8%，全局平均关节位置误差降低了14.6%，同时在低动态动作上保持了近乎完美的准确性。

Conclusion: FARM为高动态人形控制设立了新的基准，并首次提供了专门针对这一挑战的开放基准测试，代码和数据集将开源发布。

Abstract: Unified physics-based humanoid controllers are pivotal for robotics and
character animation, yet models that excel on gentle, everyday motions still
stumble on explosive actions, hampering real-world deployment. We bridge this
gap with FARM (Frame-Accelerated Augmentation and Residual Mixture-of-Experts),
an end-to-end framework composed of frame-accelerated augmentation, a robust
base controller, and a residual mixture-of-experts (MoE). Frame-accelerated
augmentation exposes the model to high-velocity pose changes by widening
inter-frame gaps. The base controller reliably tracks everyday low-dynamic
motions, while the residual MoE adaptively allocates additional network
capacity to handle challenging high-dynamic actions, significantly enhancing
tracking accuracy. In the absence of a public benchmark, we curate the
High-Dynamic Humanoid Motion (HDHM) dataset, comprising 3593 physically
plausible clips. On HDHM, FARM reduces the tracking failure rate by 42.8\% and
lowers global mean per-joint position error by 14.6\% relative to the baseline,
while preserving near-perfect accuracy on low-dynamic motions. These results
establish FARM as a new baseline for high-dynamic humanoid control and
introduce the first open benchmark dedicated to this challenge. The code and
dataset will be released at https://github.com/Colin-Jing/FARM.

Abstract: Unsupervised Skill Discovery (USD) allows agents to autonomously learn
diverse behaviors without task-specific rewards. While recent USD methods have
shown promise, their application to real-world robotics remains underexplored.
In this paper, we propose a modular USD framework to address the challenges in
the safety, interpretability, and deployability of the learned skills. Our
approach employs user-defined factorization of the state space to learn
disentangled skill representations. It assigns different skill discovery
algorithms to each factor based on the desired intrinsic reward function. To
encourage structured morphology-aware skills, we introduce symmetry-based
inductive biases tailored to individual factors. We also incorporate a style
factor and regularization penalties to promote safe and robust behaviors. We
evaluate our framework in simulation using a quadrupedal robot and demonstrate
zero-shot transfer of the learned skills to real hardware. Our results show
that factorization and symmetry lead to the discovery of structured
human-interpretable behaviors, while the style factor and penalties enhance
safety and diversity. Additionally, we show that the learned skills can be used
for downstream tasks and perform on par with oracle policies trained with
hand-crafted rewards.

Conclusion: Long-VLA为长时程机器人控制建立了新的基准，其架构无关模块可无缝集成到现有VLA模型中

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a cornerstone in robotic
policy learning, leveraging large-scale multimodal data for robust and scalable
control. However, existing VLA frameworks primarily address short-horizon
tasks, and their effectiveness on long-horizon, multi-step robotic manipulation
remains limited due to challenges in skill chaining and subtask dependencies.
In this work, we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model
specifically designed for long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a
novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask
into moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on
phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified
strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our
architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA
models. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically evaluate
long-horizon manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulated and
real-world tasks demonstrate that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic
control.

Abstract: The paper presents a visio-verbal teleimpedance interface for commanding 3D
stiffness ellipsoids to the remote robot with a combination of the operator's
gaze and verbal interaction. The gaze is detected by an eye-tracker, allowing
the system to understand the context in terms of what the operator is currently
looking at in the scene. Along with verbal interaction, a Visual Language Model
(VLM) processes this information, enabling the operator to communicate their
intended action or provide corrections. Based on these inputs, the interface
can then generate appropriate stiffness matrices for different physical
interaction actions. To validate the proposed visio-verbal teleimpedance
interface, we conducted a series of experiments on a setup including a Force
Dimension Sigma.7 haptic device to control the motion of the remote Kuka LBR
iiwa robotic arm. The human operator's gaze is tracked by Tobii Pro Glasses 2,
while human verbal commands are processed by a VLM using GPT-4o. The first
experiment explored the optimal prompt configuration for the interface. The
second and third experiments demonstrated different functionalities of the
interface on a slide-in-the-groove task.

Abstract: Leveraging human motion data to impart robots with versatile manipulation
skills has emerged as a promising paradigm in robotic manipulation.
Nevertheless, translating multi-source human hand motions into feasible robot
behaviors remains challenging, particularly for robots equipped with
multi-fingered dexterous hands characterized by complex, high-dimensional
action spaces. Moreover, existing approaches often struggle to produce policies
capable of adapting to diverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we
introduce HERMES, a human-to-robot learning framework for mobile bimanual
dexterous manipulation. First, HERMES formulates a unified reinforcement
learning approach capable of seamlessly transforming heterogeneous human hand
motions from multiple sources into physically plausible robotic behaviors.
Subsequently, to mitigate the sim2real gap, we devise an end-to-end, depth
image-based sim2real transfer method for improved generalization to real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, to enable autonomous operation in varied and
unstructured environments, we augment the navigation foundation model with a
closed-loop Perspective-n-Point (PnP) localization mechanism, ensuring precise
alignment of visual goals and effectively bridging autonomous navigation and
dexterous manipulation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HERMES
consistently exhibits generalizable behaviors across diverse, in-the-wild
scenarios, successfully performing numerous complex mobile bimanual dexterous
manipulation tasks. Project Page:https:/gemcollector.github.io/HERMES/.

Motivation: 解决离散MAPF方法轨迹质量低和连续优化方法维度灾难的问题，寻找一种既可扩展又能保证轨迹质量的多机器人运动规划方案

Method: 提出DGD框架，将非凸问题分解为可解的子问题，结合离散MAPF解决方案和约束优化技术来导向涵渋模型，并包含轻量约束修复机制

Result: 在大规模复杂环境中达到新的最高性能标准，可扩展到100台机器人，具有高规划效率和成功率

Conclusion: DGD框架成功结合了离散和连续规划方法的优势，为大规模多机器人运动规划提供了一种高效、高质量的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) involves generating collision-free
trajectories for multiple robots operating in a shared continuous workspace.
While discrete multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods are broadly adopted due
to their scalability, their coarse discretization severely limits trajectory
quality. In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer
higher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in
poor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the
limitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that
integrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models.
The resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key
characteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into
tractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines
discrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide
diffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and
(3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure
trajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art
performance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while
achieving planning efficiency and high success rates.
