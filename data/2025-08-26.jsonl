Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks\nthe advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical\ninteraction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to\nsearch-and-rescue missions.

This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to\nenhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on\nimproved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real\nmethodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a\npipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic\ndataset of grasp attempts on common objects.

Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks\nthe advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical\ninteraction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to\nsearch-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping\nin such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by\nthe need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp\nconfigurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to\nenhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on\nimproved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real\nmethodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a\npipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic\ndataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of\ninteractions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated\ngrasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was\nused to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes\nmulti-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,\ndepth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model\noutputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We\nvalidated the complete framework on a four-legged robot.

We hypothesized that real-time, rather\nthan post-task, error feedback would better increase learning speed and reduce\nerrors. Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the\nring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the\nimpact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three\ngroups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and\n(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on\nthe accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task. Participants who\nreceived real-time feedback outperformed other groups in ring orientation.\nAdditionally, participants who received feedback in replay outperformed\nparticipants who did not receive any error feedback on ring orientation during\nlong, straight path sections. There were no significant differences between\ngroups for ring position overall, but participants who received real-time\nfeedback outperformed the other groups in positional accuracy on tightly curved\npath sections.

EEG analysis discovers\nfeatures with significant delay dependence: frontal $\\theta/\\beta$-band and\nparietal $\\alpha$-band power. We also identify a threshold window (100-200 ms)\nfor early perception of delay in humans, during which these EEG features first\nexhibit significant differences. When delay exceeds 400 ms, all features\nplateau, indicating saturation of cognitive resource allocation at\nphysiological limits. These findings provide the first evidence of perceptual\nand cognitive delay thresholds during teleoperation tasks in humans, offering\ncritical neurocognitive insights for the design of delay compensation\nstrategies."}

The study\nexamines data sets from trotting and jumping experiments to understand the\nfundamental principles governing hybrid leg-thruster locomotion. Through data\nanalysis across multiple locomotion modes, this research reveals that Harpy\nachieves stable locomotion with bounded trajectories and consistent foot\nplacement through strategic leg-thruster synergy. The results demonstrate\ncontrolled joint behavior with low torques and symmetric tracking, accurate\nfoot placement within kinematic constraints despite phase-transition\nperturbations, and underactuated degree-of-freedom stability without\ndivergence. Energy level analysis reveals that legs provide primary propulsion,\nwhile the thrusters enable additional aerial phase control. The analysis\nidentifies critical body-leg coupling dynamics during aerial phases that\nrequire phase-specific control strategies. Consistent repeatability and\nsymmetry across experiments validate the robustness of the hybrid actuation\napproach."}

By\nrepresenting a swarm as a factor graph our method ensures scalability and\nrobustness in dynamic environments, relying on purely peer-to-peer message\npassing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our general framework through two\napplications where agents in a swarm must achieve consensus on global behaviour\nwhilst relying on local communication. In the first, robots must perform path\nplanning and collision avoidance to create shape formations. In the second, we\nshow how the same framework can be used by a group of robots to form a\nconsensus over a set of discrete decisions. Experimental results highlight our\nmethod's scalability and efficiency compared to recent approaches to these\nproblems making it a promising solution for multi-robot systems requiring\ndistributed consensus.

While recent self-supervised learning\nmethods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the\ncharacteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works\nconcentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths\noffered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust\ntraversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a\nmultimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and\nestimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and\ncamera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability\nlabels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging\nthese labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different\nmodalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse\ntraversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based\nsupervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,\nextensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling\nmethod consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared\nto existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal\ntraversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by\n1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets."}

Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved\npromising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual\nmanipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual\nmanipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and\nobjects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework\nnamed SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation\npolicies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid\ndangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design\ndiverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation\npatterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and\nobjects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of\ndiffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)\nto schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding\npairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically\ngenerated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual\ndemonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase\nin success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over\nstate-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.

This approach, however, struggles with\nphysical reasoning as it entangles static appearance with dynamic motion, often\nresulting in implausible visual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce the Visual Chain of Thought (Visual\nCoT): a pre-training framework that encourages a model to reason about how a\nscene evolves before predicting what it will look like. We instantiate this\nprinciple in FlowVLA, which predicts a future frame ($v_{t+1}$) only after\ngenerating an intermediate optical flow representation ($f_t$) that encodes\nmotion dynamics.
