The environmental, so-called aleatoric, uncertainty can be amplified\nin high-dimensional action spaces with complex contact dynamics, and further\nentangled with epistemic uncertainty in the models during learning phases. In\nthis work, we propose DoublyAware, an uncertainty-aware extension of Temporal\nDifference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC) that explicitly decomposes\nuncertainty into two disjoint interpretable components, i.e., planning and\npolicy uncertainties. To handle the planning uncertainty, DoublyAware employs\nconformal prediction to filter candidate trajectories using quantile-calibrated\nrisk bounds, ensuring statistical consistency and robustness against stochastic\ndynamics. Meanwhile, policy rollouts are leveraged as structured informative\npriors to support the learning phase with Group-Relative Policy Constraint\n(GRPC) optimizers that impose a group-based adaptive trust-region in the latent\naction space. This principled combination enables the robot agent to prioritize\nhigh-confidence, high-reward behavior while maintaining effective, targeted\nexploration under uncertainty.

We propose that an\nexpert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of\ncollecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our\nmethod: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current\nobservations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training\nobservations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence\nfeedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD\nobservations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform\ndeployment-time generalization.

With the MP\nclassification and prioritization, DE-AGT expands the most promising mode of\nMPs first, which eliminates unnecessary computation and finds solutions faster.\nTo obtain the cost-to-go heuristic for nonholonomic articulated vehicles, we\nrely on supervised learning and train neural networks for fast and accurate\ncost-to-go prediction. The learned heuristic is used for online mode ranking\nand node selection. Another feature of DE-AGT is the improved goal-reaching.\nExactly reaching a goal state usually requires a constant connection checking\nwith the goal by solving steering problems -- non-trivial and time-consuming\nfor articulated vehicles. The proposed termination scheme overcomes this\nchallenge by tightly integrating a light-weight trajectory tracking controller\nwith the search process. DE-AGT is implemented for autonomous parking of a\ngeneral car-like tractor with 3-trailer. Simulation results show an average of\n10x acceleration compared to a previous method."}
