We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs\nare tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general\nmulti-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain\ndistinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.\nTraditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,\nwhich has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods\nspecialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.\nHowever, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on\ncentralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,\netc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These\nassumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described\ninformally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for\ncomparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners\nto find the papers relevant to their concrete application.

The pipeline first\nprocesses point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting\nthe cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground.

This discrepancy results in a fundamental\nmisalignment between algorithmic classifications and expert judgments. To\nbridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates Semantic\nPrivileged Information (SPI) derived from large language models (LLMs) to align\nrecognition outcomes with human-interpretable reasoning. First, we introduce\nDriBehavGPT, an interactive LLM-based module that generates natural-language\ndescriptions of driving behaviors. These descriptions are then encoded into\nmachine learning-compatible representations via text embedding and\ndimensionality reduction. Finally, we incorporate them as privileged\ninformation into Support Vector Machine Plus (SVM+) for training, enabling the\nmodel to approximate human-like interpretation patterns. Experiments across\ndiverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate that our SPI-enhanced\nframework outperforms conventional methods, achieving F1-score improvements of\n7.6% (car-following) and 7.9% (lane-changing). Importantly, SPI is exclusively\nused during training, while inference relies solely on sensor data, ensuring\ncomputational efficiency without sacrificing performance. These results\nhighlight the pivotal role of semantic behavioral representations in improving\nrecognition accuracy while advancing interpretable, human-centric driving\nsystems."}

To achieve that,\nHRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and\navoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical\nconcerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for\nbuilding trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We\nemphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the\nrobot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate\nits intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,\nrobots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs\nwhile providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over\ntheir actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important\nfor bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true\ncapabilities."}
