This\npaper proposes an algorithm to achieve formation flights of fixed-wing drones\nwithout requiring any actuation over their speed. In particular, we guide all\nthe drones to travel over specific paths, e.g., parallel straight lines, and we\nsuperpose an oscillatory behavior onto the guiding vector field that drives the\ndrones to the paths. This oscillation enables control over the average velocity\nalong the path, thereby facilitating inter-drone coordination. Each drone\nadjusts its oscillation amplitude distributively in a closed-loop manner by\ncommunicating with neighboring agents in an undirected and connected graph. A\nnovel consensus algorithm is introduced, leveraging a non-negative, asymmetric\nsaturation function. This unconventional saturation is justified since negative\namplitudes do not make drones travel backward or have a negative velocity along\nthe path. Rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm is complemented by\nvalidation through numerical simulations and a real-world formation flight."}

By giving large language models (LLMs) on\nthe prioritization of tasks and the observable information available to each\nagent, our framework generates reward functions that can be dynamically\nadjusted online based on evaluation outcomes by employing more advanced\nevaluation metrics rather than the rewards themselves. This mechanism enables\nthe MAS to simultaneously achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in\ndynamic environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to\nreach superior performance levels. Our empirical studies, conducted in both\nsimulation and real-world settings, validate the practicality and effectiveness\nof our proposed approach."}

Understanding Perceptions of Embodied Robots with LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long been associated to the the\nchallenge of effectively measuring intelligence. Even if the Turing Test was\nintroduced as a means of assessing a system intelligence, its relevance and\napplication within the field of human-robot interaction remain largely\nunderexplored. This study investigates the perception of intelligence in\nembodied robots by performing a Turing Test within a robotic platform. A total\nof 34 participants were tasked with distinguishing between AI- and\nhuman-operated robots while engaging in two interactive tasks: an information\nretrieval and a package handover. These tasks assessed the robot perception and\nnavigation abilities under both static and dynamic conditions. Results indicate\nthat participants were unable to reliably differentiate between AI- and\nhuman-controlled robots beyond chance levels. Furthermore, analysis of\nparticipant responses reveals key factors influencing the perception of\nartificial versus human intelligence in embodied robotic systems. These\nfindings provide insights into the design of future interactive robots and\ncontribute to the ongoing discourse on intelligence assessment in AI-driven\nsystems."}

In the\n  proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots\n  and Systems (IROS) 2025", "summary": "The autonomous formation flight of fixed-wing drones is hard when the\ncoordination requires the actuation over their speeds since they are critically\nbounded and aircraft are mostly designed to fly at a nominal airspeed. This\npaper proposes an algorithm to achieve formation flights of fixed-wing drones\nwithout requiring any actuation over their speed. In particular, we guide all\nthe drones to travel over specific paths, e.g., parallel straight lines, and we\nsuperpose an oscillatory behavior onto the guiding vector field that drives the\ndrones to the paths. This oscillation enables control over the average velocity\nalong the path, thereby facilitating inter-drone coordination. Each drone\nadjusts its oscillation amplitude distributively in a closed-loop manner by\ncommunicating with neighboring agents in an undirected and connected graph. A\nnovel consensus algorithm is introduced, leveraging a non-negative, asymmetric\nsaturation function. This unconventional saturation is justified since negative\namplitudes do not make drones travel backward or have a negative velocity along\nthe path. Rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm is complemented by\nvalidation through numerical simulations and a real-world formation flight."}

Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying\nrobot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since\nparticipants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots.\nIn the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that\nenable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support\nmeaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112\nparticipants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos\nfrom a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The\nexperimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise\non human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM\nreflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more\npronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human\ncondition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences\nthe assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest,\nwhile collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations.\nScenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those\nwithout them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and\ninteraction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative\nrobots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design.

While optimisation methods exist for\ncontrolling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive\nknowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in\nreal-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable\nalternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of\nsample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and\npredictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the\nsafety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper\nintroduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages\nphysical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\\'ezier\ncurves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model.

On the hardware side, earlier approaches\neither use rigid-driven mechanisms, which provide precise control but are\ndifficult to design within constrained spaces, or tendon-driven mechanisms,\nwhich are more space-efficient but challenging to control. In contrast, we\npropose a hybrid actuation approach that combines the best of both worlds. The\neyes and mouth-key areas for emotional expression-are controlled using rigid\nmechanisms for precise movement, while the nose and cheek, which convey subtle\nfacial microexpressions, are driven by strings. This design allows us to build\na compact yet versatile hardware platform capable of expressing a wide range of\nemotions. On the algorithmic side, our method introduces a self-modeling\nnetwork that maps motor actions to facial landmarks, allowing us to\nautomatically establish the relationship between blendshape coefficients for\ndifferent facial expressions and the corresponding motor control signals\nthrough gradient backpropagation. We then train a neural network to map speech\ninput to corresponding blendshape controls. With our method, we can generate\ndistinct emotional expressions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and anger,\nfrom any given sentence, each with nuanced, emotion-specific control signals-a\nfeature that has not been demonstrated in earlier systems.

However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet\ndata, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents\nExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a\nself-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM\nautonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts\nrobot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this\nprocess are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of\nlearned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with\nan on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection\nimproves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and\nobserve the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative\ntool use.
