These repetitive,\nlabor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using\nlarge hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this\nwork, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of\nlarge-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules\nfor environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and\nmotion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement\nlearning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping\nlocations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the\nnumber of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses\nthe precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in\nmovement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material\nthrough dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world\nexperiments on a 40 t material handler in a representative worksite, focusing\non two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck\nloading. Comparative evaluations against human operators demonstrate the\nsystem's effectiveness in terms of precision, repeatability, and operational\nsafety.

However, previous methods focus\nnarrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware\npositioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation.\nTo address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with\ntwo-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent\nunderstanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage,\na trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to\ninstill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual\nmodule is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object\ninstances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative\nAffordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally\ninappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation\nprocess that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal\ndexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and\nfunctionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects,\nunseen instances, and even entirely novel categories."}

However, such exploration is\ninherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,\nexpert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit\ngeneralizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration\n(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering\neffort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a\ndiverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate\nthe level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization\nprocess that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate\nthat SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors\nincluding crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as\njumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real\nhardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world."}

Robots, in contrast, often\nrequire hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the\ntraining conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to\nrecover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that\nthese explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of\nhigh-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this\nwork, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring\nthese latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR\nframes few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language\nmodel iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a\nplanner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the\nobserved demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over\nconcise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous\nmanipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across\nvariations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one\ndemonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel\nsettings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines."}

These repetitive,\nlabor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using\nlarge hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this\nwork, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of\nlarge-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules\nfor environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and\nmotion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement\nlearning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping\nlocations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the\nnumber of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses\nthe precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in\nmovement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material\nthrough dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world\nexperiments on a 40 t material handler in a representative worksite, focusing\non two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck\nloading. Comparative evaluations against human operators demonstrate the\nsystem's effectiveness in terms of precision, repeatability, and operational\nsafety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete automation of\nmaterial handling tasks on a full scale."}

In this paper, we present GeoVLA, a novel\nVLA framework that effectively integrates 3D information to advance robotic\nmanipulation. It uses a vision-language model (VLM) to process images and\nlanguage instructions,extracting fused vision-language embeddings. In parallel,\nit converts depth maps into point clouds and employs a customized point\nencoder, called Point Embedding Network, to generate 3D geometric embeddings\nindependently. These produced embeddings are then concatenated and processed by\nour proposed spatial-aware action expert, called 3D-enhanced Action Expert,\nwhich combines information from different sensor modalities to produce precise\naction sequences. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and\nreal-world environments, GeoVLA demonstrates superior performance and\nrobustness.
