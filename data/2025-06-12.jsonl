However, the accumulated noise\nin such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which\ndegrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed\ndetections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet\nDenoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event\ncameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which\nenables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet\ntransform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such\na method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted\nfeatures are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object\nprediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic\nReorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid\nencoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object\ndetection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that\nWD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement\nour approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin\nNX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16,\nwhich is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic\nsystems."}

Non-prehensile\ntransport can significantly improve transport efficiency, as it enables\nhandling multiple objects simultaneously and accommodating objects unsuitable\nfor parallel-jaw or suction grasps. Existing approaches incorporate constraints\nbased on the Coulomb friction model, which is imprecise during fast motions\nwhere inherent mechanical vibrations occur. Imprecise constraints can cause\ntransported objects to slide or even fall off the tray. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel method to learn a friction model using acoustic\nsensing that maps a tray's motion profile to a dynamically conditioned friction\ncoefficient. This learned model enables an optimization-based motion planner to\nadjust the friction constraint at each control step according to the planned\nmotion at that step. In experiments, we generate time-optimized trajectories\nfor a UR5e robot to transport various objects with constraints using both the\nstandard Coulomb friction model and the learned friction model.

However, most existing AV safety evaluation methods are primarily\ndesigned for simple maneuvers such as car-following and lane-changing. While\nsuitable for basic tests, these methods are insufficient for assessing\nhigh-level automation functions deployed in more complex environments. First,\nthese methods typically use crash rate as the evaluation metric, whose accuracy\nheavily depends on the quality and completeness of naturalistic driving\nenvironment data used to estimate scenario probabilities. Such data is often\ndifficult and expensive to collect. Second, when applied to diverse scenarios,\nthese methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, making large-scale\nevaluation computationally intractable. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a novel framework for full-scenario AV safety evaluation. A unified\nmodel is first introduced to standardize the representation of diverse driving\nscenarios. This modeling approach constrains the dimension of most scenarios to\na regular highway setting with three lanes and six surrounding background\nvehicles, significantly reducing dimensionality. To further avoid the\nlimitations of probability-based method, we propose a volume-based evaluation\nmethod that quantifies the proportion of risky scenarios within the entire\nscenario space. For car-following scenarios, we prove that the set of safe\nscenarios is convex under specific settings, enabling exact volume computation.\nExperimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed volume-based\nmethod using both AV behavior models from existing literature and six\nproduction AV models calibrated from field-test trajectory data in the Ultra-AV\ndataset.

In this work, we introduce the\nPerception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that\nquantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected,\nincorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the\nSensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a\nsensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear\nand daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target\nobjects.

It requires precise planning\nwhen possible footholds are sparse, robustness against uncertainties and\ndisturbances, and generalizability across diverse terrains. While traditional\nmodel-based controllers excel at planning on complex terrains, they struggle\nwith real-world uncertainties. Learning-based controllers offer robustness to\nsuch uncertainties but often lack precision on terrains with sparse steppable\nareas. Hybrid methods achieve enhanced robustness on sparse terrains by\ncombining both methods but are computationally demanding and constrained by the\ninherent limitations of model-based planners. To achieve generalized legged\nlocomotion on diverse terrains while preserving the robustness of\nlearning-based controllers, this paper proposes to learn an attention-based map\nencoding conditioned on robot proprioception, which is trained as part of the\nend-to-end controller using reinforcement learning. We show that the network\nlearns to focus on steppable areas for future footholds when the robot\ndynamically navigates diverse and challenging terrains.

To address this\nissue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for\ncontinual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a\ntask-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a\nsingle task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares\n(RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific\nmodels. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model\nselection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The\nscheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics\n(autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant\nlearning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a\nreal-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to\nforgetting and strong adaptability to task variations.
