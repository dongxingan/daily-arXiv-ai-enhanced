Among these, quadruped robots with\nmanipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.\nHowever, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of\nintegrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic\narm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.\nTeleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high\nlevel of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load\non the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that\ndirectly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler\nand more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by\nleveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external\ncamera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist\nposition. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to\ncontrol the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe\nteleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and\nthe robotic arm itself.

Neural simulators have\nemerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,\ncapable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world\ndata; however, existing neural simulators typically require\napplication-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or\nenvironments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.\nIn this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural\nsimulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We\npropose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models\nfor predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact\nconstraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers\nin an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant\nsimulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an\ninterchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We\nconduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and\naccurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and\nenvironment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural\nengine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from\nreal-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeRD是一种神经网络机器人动力学模拟器，能够替代传统分析模拟器中的底层动力学和接触求解器，实现稳定准确的长期模拟，并具有良好的泛化能力和从真实数据微调的能力。", "motivation": "现代机器人具有高自由度和复杂机构，传统分析模拟器难以准确高效模拟。现有神经模拟器需要针对特定应用训练，无法泛化到新任务和环境，主要原因是全局状态表示不足。", "method": "提出NeRD（神经机器人动力学）模型，采用机器人中心且空间不变的模拟状态表示，替代传统模拟器中的底层动力学和接触求解器，并集成到先进机器人模拟器中作为可互换的后端求解器。", "result": "实验表明NeRD模拟器在数千个模拟步骤中保持稳定准确；能够跨任务和环境配置泛化；支持在神经引擎中完全进行策略学习；可以从真实世界数据微调以缩小模拟与现实的差距。", "conclusion": "NeRD为解决机器人神经模拟器的泛化问题提供了有效方案，通过创新的状态表示和集成方法，实现了比传统模拟器更好的性能和适应性，特别是在接触约束下的刚体动力学模拟方面表现出色。"}}
