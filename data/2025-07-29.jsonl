To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,\nthis work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework\nof model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive\ncompensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,\nthe LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a\nreference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the\nunknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.\nExperiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided\nadaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive\ncontrol, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world\nenvironments.

However, most current\nsystems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners,\nrendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in\ndynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces the \"Think, Act, Learn\" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that\nenables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through\ncontinuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an\nLLM first \"thinks\" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.\nThe robot then \"acts\" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal\nsensory feedback. Critically, the \"learn\" module processes this feedback to\nfacilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal\nanalysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are\nstored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world\nthat our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including\nopen-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our\nframework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks,\nconverges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits\nremarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant\nstep towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic\nagents."}

To address this challenge, this paper proposes\nMS-NN-steer, a new Model-Structured Neural Network for vehicle steering\ncontrol, integrating the prior knowledge of the nonlinear vehicle dynamics into\nthe neural architecture. The proposed controller is validated using real-world\ndata from the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League (A2RL) competition, with\nfull-scale autonomous race cars. In comparison with general-purpose NNs,\nMS-NN-steer is shown to achieve better accuracy and generalization with small\ntraining datasets, while being less sensitive to the weights' initialization.\nAlso, MS-NN-steer outperforms the steering controller used by the A2RL winning\nteam.

Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted\nobjectives or morphological similarity, limiting their capacity for\ngeneralization. Here, we introduce a framework that enables agents with diverse\nembodiments to learn wholebbody interaction behaviors directly from human\ndemonstrations. The framework extracts a compact, transferable representation\nof interaction dynamics, called the Embedded Interaction Graph (EIG), which\ncaptures key spatiotemporal relationships between the interacting agents. This\ngraph is then used as an imitation objective to train control policies in\nphysics-based simulations, allowing the agent to generate motions that are both\nsemantically meaningful and physically feasible.

Most existing work\nfocuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have\nexplored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts\nare restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and\nlack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,\nthis work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework\nof model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive\ncompensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,\nthe LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a\nreference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the\nunknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.\nExperiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided\nadaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive\ncontrol, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world\nenvironments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms\ntraditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity\ncompared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and\nreasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator\nenables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical\nderivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,\nadaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying\nLLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and\npracticality compared to vision-language models."}

To address these challenges,\nthis paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging\nframework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal,\ndynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A\nvoxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify\nand reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal\nmodule is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved\nstatic local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic\nenvironments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are\nconducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures.

While prior research has focused\non fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous\nnavigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study\naddresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss\nstructures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces\nseveral approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus\nbackground from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into\ntwo categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical\napproach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the\neigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced\ndeep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3\nare trained and evaluated for the same task.

Existing research focuses primarily on\ncrowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to\nAVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic\nboundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed\nbehavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions.
