Achieving\nautonomous operation requires systems to navigate safely through complex and\nunfamiliar environments. This level of autonomy is particularly challenging due\nto the complexity of such environments and the need for real-time decision\nmaking especially for platforms constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP),\nwhich limits flight time and precludes the use of bulky sensors like Light\nDetection and Ranging (LiDAR) for mapping.

Traditional methods typically treat\neach new context as a separate task with its own reward function. For example,\nif a previously ignored stove becomes too hot to be around, the robot must\nlearn a new reward from scratch, even though the underlying preference for\nprioritizing safety over efficiency remains unchanged. We observe that context\ninfluences not the underlying preference itself, but rather the\n$\\textit{saliency}$--or importance--of reward features. For instance, stove\nheat affects the importance of the robot's proximity, yet the human's safety\npreference stays the same. Existing multi-task and meta IRL methods learn\ncontext-dependent representations $\\textit{implicitly}$--without distinguishing\nbetween preferences and feature importance--resulting in substantial data\nrequirements. Instead, we propose $\\textit{explicitly}$ modeling\ncontext-invariant preferences separately from context-dependent feature\nsaliency, creating modular reward representations that adapt to new contexts.\nTo achieve this, we introduce $\\textit{calibrated features}$--representations\nthat capture contextual effects on feature saliency--and present specialized\npaired comparison queries that isolate saliency from preference for efficient\nlearning. Experiments with simulated users show our method significantly\nimproves sample efficiency, requiring 10x fewer preference queries than\nbaselines to achieve equivalent reward accuracy, with up to 15% better\nperformance in low-data regimes (5-10 queries).

The key\ncontribution is a novel task allocation framework that incorporates the\nconsideration of physical constraints introduced by multitasking. This is in\ncontrast to the existing work where such constraints are largely ignored. After\nformulating the problem, we propose a compilation to weighted MAX-SAT, which\nallows us to leverage existing solvers for a solution. A more efficient greedy\nheuristic is then introduced.

Recently, a variant of IL, called\nIn-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant\npolicies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform\na new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale\ndemonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined\nby hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally\ngenerates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success\nrates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

This\nleads to significant difficulties in generalizing across diverse radar data\ntypes, with modality-aware approaches that could leverage the complementary\nstrengths of heterogeneous radar remaining unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we\npropose SHeRLoc, the first deep network tailored for heterogeneous radar, which\nutilizes RCS polar matching to align multimodal radar data. Our hierarchical\noptimal transport-based feature aggregation method generates rotationally\nrobust multi-scale descriptors. By employing FFT-similarity-based data mining\nand adaptive margin-based triplet loss, SHeRLoc enables FOV-aware metric\nlearning. SHeRLoc achieves an order of magnitude improvement in heterogeneous\nradar place recognition, increasing recall@1 from below 0.1 to 0.9 on a public\ndataset and outperforming state of-the-art methods. Also applicable to LiDAR,\nSHeRLoc paves the way for cross-modal place recognition and heterogeneous\nsensor SLAM. The source code will be available upon acceptance."}

However, in complex environments,\nthe number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical\nproperties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a\nsingle global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system\nidentification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant\naspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation\nof energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility\nfor any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,\nparticularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model\nPredictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it\ncontext-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system\nidentification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed\ncontrol. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the\nfact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our\nmethod on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our\nmethod reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%\nimprovement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter."}
