Webpage and additional\n  videos at https://montrealrobotics.ca/perpetua/", "summary": "Many robotic systems require extended deployments in complex, dynamic\nenvironments. In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between\nsubsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling\nalgorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables\npredicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state\nobservations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This\npaper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static\nfeatures. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics\nof the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to\nenable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together\nmixtures of \"persistence\" and \"emergence\" filters to model the probability that\nfeatures will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The\napproach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating\nthe states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at\narbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,\nwe find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also\nbeing online adaptable and robust to missing observations."}

We introduce the Gauss-Legendre Rectangle (GLR)\nalgorithm, a principled two-stage integration method that estimates collision\nrisk by combining Gauss-Legendre with a non-homogeneous Poisson process over\ntime. GLR produces accurate risk estimates that account for vehicle geometry\nand trajectory uncertainty. In experiments across 446 overtaking scenarios in a\nhigh-fidelity Formula One racing simulation, GLR outperforms five\nstate-of-the-art baselines achieving an average error reduction of 77% and\nsurpassing the next-best method by 52%, all while running at 1000 Hz.

We introduce a\nnovel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are\nequivariant to 90{\\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two\nplanes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by\na new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of\ndeformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.\nThis allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while\npreserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations\nof two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically,\nwe derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism\nand propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow\nmatching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed\nequivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated\nand real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed\nprojection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory\ncosts.

Reinforcement\nlearning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to\nlearn through trial and error in simulation.

An adaptive\nmechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring\nexposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical.
