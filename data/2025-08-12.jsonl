It represents a significant advancement\nin addressing the challenges associated with manual sewing processes.\nTraditional methods for creating pleats are labour-intensive, prone to\ninconsistencies, and require high levels of skill, making automation a critical\nneed in the apparel industry. This research explores the technical feasibility\nand operational benefits of integrating advanced technologies into garment\nproduction, focusing on the creation of an automated machine capable of precise\nfolding and sewing operations and eliminating the marking operation.\n  The proposed machine incorporates key features such as a precision folding\nmechanism integrated into the automated sewing unit with real-time monitoring\ncapabilities. The results demonstrate remarkable improvements: the standard\nlabour time has been reduced by 93%, dropping from 117 seconds per piece to\njust 8 seconds with the automated system. Similarly, machinery time improved by\n73%, and the total output rate increased by 72%. These enhancements translate\ninto a cycle time reduction from 117 seconds per piece to an impressive 33\nseconds, enabling manufacturers to meet customer demand more swiftly.

In this paper we find that learning the functional relationships while\naccounting for the uncertainty about the structural information leads to more\nrobust dynamics models which improves downstream planning, while using\nsignificantly lower computational resources. This in contrast with common\nmodel-learning methods that ignore the causal structure and fail to leverage\nthe sparsity of interactions in robotic systems. We achieve this by estimating\na causal structure distribution that is used to sample causal graphs that\ninform the latent-space representations in an encoder-multidecoder\nprobabilistic model. We show that our model can be used to learn the dynamics\nof a robot, which together with a sampling-based planner can be used to perform\nnew tasks in novel environments, provided an objective function for the new\nrequirement is available. We validate our method using manipulators and mobile\nrobots in both simulation and the real-world. Additionally, we validate the\nlearned dynamics' adaptability and increased robustness to corrupted inputs and\nchanges in the environment, which is highly desirable in challenging real-world\nrobotics scenarios.

Traditional path planner, such\nas Artificial Potential Field (APF), offer computational efficiency but suffer\nfrom local minima issue due to position-based potential field functions and\noscillatory motion near the obstacles due to Newtonian mechanics. To address\nthis limitation, an Energy-based Artificial Potential Field (APF) framework is\nproposed in this paper that integrates position and velocity-dependent\npotential functions. E-APF ensures dynamic adaptability and mitigates local\nminima, enabling uninterrupted progression toward the goal. The proposed\nframework integrates E-APF with a hybrid trajectory optimizer that jointly\nminimizes jerk and execution time under velocity and acceleration constraints,\nensuring geometric smoothness and time efficiency. The entire framework is\nvalidated in simulation using the 7-degree-of-freedom Kinova Gen3 robotic\nmanipulator. The results demonstrate collision-free, smooth, time-efficient,\nand oscillation-free trajectory in the presence of obstacles, highlighting the\nefficacy of the combined trajectory optimization and real-time obstacle\navoidance approach.

Submitted to AAAI'26", "summary": "Long-Horizon (LH) tasks in Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) are complex\nmulti-step tasks that require continuous planning, sequential decision-making,\nand extended execution across domains to achieve the final goal. However,\nexisting methods heavily rely on skill chaining by concatenating pre-trained\nsubtasks, with environment observations and self-state tightly coupled, lacking\nthe ability to generalize to new combinations of environments and skills,\nfailing to complete various LH tasks across domains. To solve this problem,\nthis paper presents DETACH, a cross-domain learning framework for LH tasks via\nbiologically inspired dual-stream disentanglement. Inspired by the brain's\n\"where-what\" dual pathway mechanism, DETACH comprises two core modules: i) an\nenvironment learning module for spatial understanding, which captures object\nfunctions, spatial relationships, and scene semantics, achieving cross-domain\ntransfer through complete environment-self disentanglement; ii) a skill\nlearning module for task execution, which processes self-state information\nincluding joint degrees of freedom and motor patterns, enabling cross-skill\ntransfer through independent motor pattern encoding. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on various LH tasks in HSI scenes. Compared with existing methods,\nDETACH can achieve an average subtasks success rate improvement of 23% and\naverage execution efficiency improvement of 29%."}

In this paper, we propose a\ncapsizing-aware trajectory planner (CAP) to achieve trajectory planning on the\nuneven terrain. The tip-over stability of the robot on rough terrain is\nanalyzed. Based on the tip-over stability, we define the traversable\norientation, which indicates the safe range of robot orientations.
