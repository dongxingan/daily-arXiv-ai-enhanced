Abstract: One of the most critical features for the successful operation of autonomous
UAVs is the ability to make decisions based on the information acquired from
their surroundings. Each UAV must be able to make decisions during the flight
in order to deal with uncertainties in its system and the environment, and to
further act upon the information being received. Such decisions influence the
future behavior of the UAV, which is expressed as the path plan. Thus,
decision-making in path planning is an enabling technique for deploying
autonomous UAVs in real-world applications. This survey provides an overview of
existing studies that use aspects of decision-making in path planning,
presenting the research strands for Exploration Path Planning and Informative
Path Planning, and focusing on characteristics of how data have been modeled
and understood. Finally, we highlight the existing challenges for relevant
topics in this field.

Abstract: Autonomous robots that rely on deep neural network controllers pose critical
challenges for safety prediction, especially under partial observability and
distribution shift. Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited
in scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while
model-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction
in end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition
model nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of
world models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to
forecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the
probability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic
and composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to
quantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from
high-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator
can deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding
prediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to
miscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised
domain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution
shift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides
theoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across
long prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that
our UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower
false positive rates under distribution shift. Similarly, world model-based
composite predictors outperform their monolithic counterparts on long-horizon
tasks, and our conformal calibration provides reliable statistical bounds.

### [3] [CLF-RL: Control Lyapunov Function Guided Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09354)
*Kejun Li,Zachary Olkin,Yisong Yue,Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模型轨迹生成和控制李雅普诺夫函数（CLF）的结构化奖励塑造框架，用于强化学习（RL）策略训练，显著提高了双足机器人的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL在双足机器人运动控制中存在奖励设计繁琐和目标敏感性高的问题，需要一种更有效的奖励塑造方法。

Method: 结合模型轨迹生成（LIP模型和HZD步态库）和CLF构建奖励函数，引导策略学习，训练后仅保留轻量级策略。

Result: 在仿真和Unitree G1机器人实验中，CLF-RL表现出比基线RL策略更高的鲁棒性和性能。

Conclusion: 结构化奖励塑造框架有效解决了RL在双足机器人运动控制中的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in generating robust locomotion
policies for bipedal robots, but often suffers from tedious reward design and
sensitivity to poorly shaped objectives. In this work, we propose a structured
reward shaping framework that leverages model-based trajectory generation and
control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) to guide policy learning. We explore two
model-based planners for generating reference trajectories: a reduced-order
linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model for velocity-conditioned motion planning,
and a precomputed gait library based on hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) using
full-order dynamics. These planners define desired end-effector and joint
trajectories, which are used to construct CLF-based rewards that penalize
tracking error and encourage rapid convergence. This formulation provides
meaningful intermediate rewards, and is straightforward to implement once a
reference is available. Both the reference trajectories and CLF shaping are
used only during training, resulting in a lightweight policy at deployment. We
validate our method both in simulation and through extensive real-world
experiments on a Unitree G1 robot. CLF-RL demonstrates significantly improved
robustness relative to the baseline RL policy and better performance than a
classic tracking reward RL formulation.

### [4] [DAgger Diffusion Navigation: DAgger Boosted Diffusion Policy for Vision-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09444)
*Haoxiang Shi,Xiang Deng,Zaijing Li,Gongwei Chen,Yaowei Wang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DifNav的端到端优化方法，通过扩散策略统一了传统两阶段的路径点生成与规划，解决了现有方法的全局次优化和性能瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两阶段路径点规划框架存在全局次优化和性能瓶颈问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav)，使用条件扩散策略直接建模连续导航空间中的多模态动作分布，并结合DAgger进行在线策略训练和专家轨迹增强。

Result: 实验表明，DifNav在导航性能上显著优于现有的两阶段路径点模型。

Conclusion: DifNav通过端到端优化和扩散策略，显著提升了连续环境中的视觉语言导航性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires
agents to follow natural language instructions through free-form 3D spaces.
Existing VLN-CE approaches typically use a two-stage waypoint planning
framework, where a high-level waypoint predictor generates the navigable
waypoints, and then a navigation planner suggests the intermediate goals in the
high-level action space. However, this two-stage decomposition framework
suffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each
stage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the
quality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,
we propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE
policy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and
planning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional
diffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future
actions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint
predictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible
instruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in
imitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation
tasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory
augmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This
approach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to
recover from error states. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that, even without a waypoint predictor, the proposed method
substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art two-stage waypoint-based
models in terms of navigation performance. Our code is available at:

### [5] [HapticGiant: A Novel Very Large Kinesthetic Haptic Interface with Hierarchical Force Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09595)

Result: 实验证明HapticGiant及其控制方案有效，为高沉浸感虚拟现实应用铺平道路。

Conclusion: HapticGiant通过匹配人类手臂特性和优化控制方案，显著提升了虚拟现实的触觉沉浸感。

Abstract: Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to
enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially
available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited
workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the
human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale
kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm
as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while
providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel
admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to
render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances.
Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations,
including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its
control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality
applications.

### [6] [Reactive Model Predictive Contouring Control for Robot Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09502)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于RMPCC的机器人路径跟踪框架，能在动态环境中以100 Hz频率避开障碍物、奇异点和自碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径跟踪方法依赖时间参数化，难以同时处理碰撞和奇异点避免，且运动学限制下误差较大。

Method: 通过路径参数化参考路径，利用RMPCC优化，引入CBF避免碰撞和奇异点，采用Jacobian线性化和Gauss-Newton Hessian近似实现高速求解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动态环境中表现优异，轮廓误差和机器人加速度低，性能优于现有方法10倍。

Conclusion: RMPCC框架在动态环境中高效、稳定，适用于实时路径跟踪任务。

Abstract: This contribution presents a robot path-following framework via Reactive
Model Predictive Contouring Control (RMPCC) that successfully avoids obstacles,
singularities and self-collisions in dynamic environments at 100 Hz. Many
path-following methods rely on the time parametrization, but struggle to handle
collision and singularity avoidance while adhering kinematic limits or other
constraints. Specifically, the error between the desired path and the actual
position can become large when executing evasive maneuvers. Thus, this paper
derives a method that parametrizes the reference path by a path parameter and
performs the optimization via RMPCC. In particular, Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) are introduced to avoid collisions and singularities in dynamic
environments. A Jacobian-based linearization and Gauss-Newton Hessian
approximation enable solving the nonlinear RMPCC problem at 100 Hz,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a factor of 10. Experiments confirm
that the framework handles dynamic obstacles in real-world settings with low
contouring error and low robot acceleration.

*Reema Raval,Shalabh Gupta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SMART-OC算法为无人水面艇（USV）在动态海洋环境中提供实时时间-风险最优路径重规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 仿真实验表明，USV能快速重规划路径，避开动态障碍并利用洋流成功到达目标。

Conclusion: SMART-OC有效解决了USV在动态环境中的实时导航问题。

Abstract: Typical marine environments are highly complex with spatio-temporally varying
currents and dynamic obstacles, presenting significant challenges to Unmanned
Surface Vehicles (USVs) for safe and efficient navigation. Thus, the USVs need
to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid
collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting
ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called
Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents
(SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic
environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time
cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of
SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV
performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents
to successfully reach the goal.

### [9] [A Shank Angle-Based Control System Enables Soft Exoskeleton to Assist Human Non-Steady Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09876)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于小腿角度的外骨骼控制系统，能够在非稳态步态中实时协调人类步态，并动态调整辅助模式以适应不同活动中的生物踝关节力矩模式。

Conclusion: 该系统为外骨骼在复杂步态活动中的应用提供了可行方案，具有实际推广潜力。

Abstract: Exoskeletons have been shown to effectively assist humans during steady
locomotion. However, their effects on non-steady locomotion, characterized by
nonlinear phase progression within a gait cycle, remain insufficiently
explored, particularly across diverse activities. This work presents a shank
angle-based control system that enables the exoskeleton to maintain real-time
coordination with human gait, even under phase perturbations, while dynamically
shaping assistance profiles to match the biological ankle moment patterns
across walking, running, stair negotiation tasks. The control system consists
of an assistance profile online generation method and a model-based feedforward
control method. The assistance profile is formulated as a dual-Gaussian model
with the shank angle as the independent variable. Leveraging only IMU
measurements, the model parameters are updated online each stride to adapt to
inter- and intra-individual biomechanical variability. The profile tracking
control employs a human-exoskeleton kinematics and stiffness model as a
feedforward component, reducing reliance on historical control data due to the
lack of clear and consistent periodicity in non-steady locomotion. Three
experiments were conducted using a lightweight soft exoskeleton with multiple
subjects. The results validated the effectiveness of each individual method,
demonstrated the robustness of the control system against gait perturbations
across various activities, and revealed positive biomechanical and
physiological responses of human users to the exoskeleton's mechanical
assistance.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为未来3D空间中的电缆布线提供了参考。

Abstract: The manipulation of deformable linear flexures has a wide range of
applications in industry, such as cable routing in automotive manufacturing and
textile production. Cable routing, as a complex multi-stage robot manipulation
scenario, is a challenging task for robot automation. Common parallel
two-finger grippers have the risk of over-squeezing and over-tension when
grasping and guiding cables. In this paper, a novel eagle-inspired fingernail
is designed and mounted on the gripper fingers, which helps with cable grasping
on planar surfaces and in-hand cable guiding operations. Then we present a
single-grasp end-to-end 3D cable routing framework utilizing the proposed
fingernails, instead of the common pick-and-place strategy. Continuous control
is achieved to efficiently manipulate cables through vision-based state
estimation of task configurations and offline trajectory planning based on
motion primitives. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with
a variety of cables and channel slots, significantly outperforming the
pick-and-place manipulation process under equivalent perceptual conditions. Our
reconfigurable task setting and the proposed framework provide a reference for
future cable routing manipulations in 3D space.

Abstract: Multi-vehicle trajectory planning (MVTP) is one of the key challenges in
multi-robot systems (MRSs) and has broad applications across various fields.
This paper presents ESCoT, an enhanced step-based coordinate trajectory
planning method for multiple car-like robots. ESCoT incorporates two key
strategies: collaborative planning for local robot groups and replanning for
duplicate configurations. These strategies effectively enhance the performance
of step-based MVTP methods. Through extensive experiments, we show that ESCoT
1) in sparse scenarios, significantly improves solution quality compared to
baseline step-based method, achieving up to 70% improvement in typical conflict
scenarios and 34% in randomly generated scenarios, while maintaining high
solving efficiency; and 2) in dense scenarios, outperforms all baseline
methods, maintains a success rate of over 50% even in the most challenging
configurations. The results demonstrate that ESCoT effectively solves MVTP,
further extending the capabilities of step-based methods. Finally, practical
robot tests validate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: As intelligent robots become more integrated into human environments, there
is a growing need for intuitive and reliable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
interfaces that are adaptable and more natural to interact with. Traditional
robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize
predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments.
This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language
understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs)
with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural
language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions
by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular
integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as
person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series
of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in
real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of
approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots.

Furthermore, the learned policies achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real
transfer, demonstrating remarkable agility and safety in real-world
experiments, running in real time on an onboard computer.

Conclusion: 机械特性和交互策略需结合时间动态来深入理解触觉感知。

Abstract: To enable robots to develop human-like fine manipulation, it is essential to
understand how mechanical compliance, multi-modal sensing, and purposeful
interaction jointly shape tactile perception. In this study, we use a dedicated
modular e-Skin with tunable mechanical compliance and multi-modal sensing
(normal, shear forces and vibrations) to systematically investigate how sensing
embodiment and interaction strategies influence robotic perception of objects.
Leveraging a curated set of soft wave objects with controlled viscoelastic and
surface properties, we explore a rich set of palpation primitives-pressing,
precession, sliding that vary indentation depth, frequency, and directionality.
In addition, we propose the latent filter, an unsupervised, action-conditioned
deep state-space model of the sophisticated interaction dynamics and infer
causal mechanical properties into a structured latent space. This provides
generalizable and in-depth interpretable representation of how embodiment and
interaction determine and influence perception. Our investigation demonstrates
that multi-modal sensing outperforms uni-modal sensing. It highlights a nuanced
interaction between the environment and mechanical properties of e-Skin, which
should be examined alongside the interaction by incorporating temporal
dynamics.

whole-body bilateral teleoperation with an online multi-stage object inertial
parameter estimation module, which is the core technical contribution of this
work. The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object
size estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language
model (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size
estimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial
parameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based
refinement and improving the overall estimation speed. A hierarchical strategy
first estimates mass and center of mass, then infers inertia from object size
to ensure physically feasible parameters, while a decoupled multi-hypothesis
scheme enhances robustness to VLM prior errors. Our estimator operates in
parallel with high-fidelity simulation and hardware, enabling real-time online
updates. The estimated parameters are then used to update the wheeled
humanoid's equilibrium point, allowing the operator to focus more on locomotion
and manipulation. This integration improves the haptic force feedback for
dynamic synchronization, enabling more dynamic whole-body teleoperation. By
compensating for object dynamics using the estimated parameters, the framework
also improves manipulation tracking while preserving compliant behavior. We
validate the system on a customized wheeled humanoid with a robotic gripper and
human-machine interface, demonstrating real-time execution of lifting,
delivering, and releasing tasks with a payload weighing approximately one-third
of the robot's body weight.

Abstract: Human-robot teaming (HRT) systems often rely on large-scale datasets of human
and robot interactions, especially for close-proximity collaboration tasks such
as human-robot handovers. Learning robot manipulation policies from raw,
real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the
physical environment. Although simulation training offers a cost-effective
alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace
remains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies,
focusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need
for real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable
the robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while
avoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages
sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes
to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a
camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose
changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose
changes. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and
real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method
serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover
task, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT.

Abstract: The legged locomotion in spatially constrained structures (called crawl
spaces) is challenging. In crawl spaces, current exteroceptive locomotion
learning methods are limited by large noises and errors of the sensors in
possible low visibility conditions, and current proprioceptive locomotion
learning methods are difficult in traversing crawl spaces because only ground
features are inferred. In this study, a point cloud supervised proprioceptive
locomotion reinforcement learning method for legged robots in crawl spaces is
proposed. A state estimation network is designed to estimate the robot's
surrounding ground and spatial features as well as the robot's collision states
using historical proprioceptive sensor data. The point cloud is represented in
polar coordinate frame and a point cloud processing method is proposed to
efficiently extract the ground and spatial features that are used to supervise
the state estimation network learning. Comprehensive reward functions that
guide the robot to traverse through crawl spaces after collisions are designed.
Experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our method exhibits
more agile locomotion in crawl spaces. This study enhances the ability of
legged robots to traverse spatially constrained environments without requiring
exteroceptive sensors.

Abstract: The creation of human-like humanoid robots is hindered by a fundamental
fragmentation: data processing and learning algorithms are rarely universal
across different robot morphologies. This paper introduces the Generalized
Behavior Cloning (GBC) framework, a comprehensive and unified solution designed
to solve this end-to-end challenge. GBC establishes a complete pathway from
human motion to robot action through three synergistic innovations. First, an
adaptive data pipeline leverages a differentiable IK network to automatically
retarget any human MoCap data to any humanoid. Building on this foundation, our
novel DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with its MMTransformer architecture learns robust,
high-fidelity imitation policies. To complete the ecosystem, the entire
framework is delivered as an efficient, open-source platform based on Isaac
Lab, empowering the community to deploy the full workflow via simple
configuration scripts. We validate the power and generality of GBC by training
policies on multiple heterogeneous humanoids, demonstrating excellent
performance and transfer to novel motions. This work establishes the first
practical and unified pathway for creating truly generalized humanoid
controllers.

Method: 1. 提出边际增益优势估计（MGAE），通过滑动窗口基线优化奖励优势函数；2. 开发基于语义掩码的语义动态模型（SDM），提供高效短期预测；3. 设计约束演员动态估计器（CADE），整合模型和安全强化学习框架。

Conclusion: CADE框架在训练和推理中有效平衡奖励与安全，为复杂环境下的无人机任务提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-driven autonomous river following by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is
critical for applications such as rescue, surveillance, and environmental
monitoring, particularly in dense riverine environments where GPS signals are
unreliable. We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which
the reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique
river segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov
Decision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which
refines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline
computed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage
estimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in
non-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on
patchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and
data-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent
vision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics
Estimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM
for cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of
solving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.
Simulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and
superior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized
Advantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions
that enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,
CADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the
Lagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during
training, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard
action overlay.

Conclusion: 通过视觉体现差距的显式缩小，人类视频成为提升机器人策略的宝贵数据源。

Abstract: Robot manipulation research still suffers from significant data scarcity:
even the largest robot datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less
diverse than those that fueled recent breakthroughs in language and vision. We
introduce Masquerade, a method that edits in-the-wild egocentric human videos
to bridge the visual embodiment gap between humans and robots and then learns a
robot policy with these edited videos. Our pipeline turns each human video into
robotized demonstrations by (i) estimating 3-D hand poses, (ii) inpainting the
human arms, and (iii) overlaying a rendered bimanual robot that tracks the
recovered end-effector trajectories. Pre-training a visual encoder to predict
future 2-D robot keypoints on 675K frames of these edited clips, and continuing
that auxiliary loss while fine-tuning a diffusion policy head on only 50 robot
demonstrations per task, yields policies that generalize significantly better
than prior work. On three long-horizon, bimanual kitchen tasks evaluated in
three unseen scenes each, Masquerade outperforms baselines by 5-6x. Ablations
show that both the robot overlay and co-training are indispensable, and
performance scales logarithmically with the amount of edited human video. These
results demonstrate that explicitly closing the visual embodiment gap unlocks a
vast, readily available source of data from human videos that can be used to
improve robot policies.
