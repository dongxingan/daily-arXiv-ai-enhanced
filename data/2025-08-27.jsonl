However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane\nscenarios vastly outnumber rare \"long-tail\" events, leads to brittle and unsafe\npolicies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address\nthis challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data\ncuration strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich\nsamples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are\ncategorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and\nbehavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual\ntimestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned\nConservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based\narchitecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our\nresults demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the\nbaseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal\nachieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate\nby nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear\ntrade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while\nscenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that\nintelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and\nreliable autonomous agents."}

Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt\ndesign that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user\ntasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and\nthe high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to\ntremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly\nundermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.\nThis paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i)\nprovides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii)\nenhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based\nfine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is\nproposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs,\nbridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the\nRSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by\nthe LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until\nbeing verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the\nLLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution,\nsignificantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.\nExperiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range\nof LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs."}

DELIVER unifies\nnatural language understanding, spatial decomposition, relay planning, and\nmotion execution to enable scalable, collision-free coordination in real-world\nsettings. Given a spoken or written instruction, a lightweight instance of\nLLaMA3 interprets the command to extract pickup and delivery locations. The\nenvironment is partitioned using a Voronoi tessellation to define\nrobot-specific operating regions. Robots then compute optimal relay points\nalong shared boundaries and coordinate handoffs. A finite-state machine governs\neach robot's behavior, enabling robust execution. We implement DELIVER on the\nMultiTRAIL simulation platform and validate it in both ROS2-based Gazebo\nsimulations and real-world hardware using TurtleBot3 robots. Empirical results\nshow that DELIVER maintains consistent mission cost across varying team sizes\nwhile reducing per-agent workload by up to 55% compared to a single-agent\nsystem. Moreover, the number of active relay agents remains low even as team\nsize increases, demonstrating the system's scalability and efficient agent\nutilization.
