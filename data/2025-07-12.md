### [1] [Classifying Emergence in Robot Swarms: An Observer-Dependent Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07315)
*Ricardo Vega,Cameron Nowzari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了“涌现”和“群体”缺乏正式定义的问题，提出了一个框架，通过区分可观察和不可观察状态来讨论这些概念，并强调其主观性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对“涌现”和“群体”缺乏共识，新老研究者难以统一理解，影响研究和应用。

Method: 提出框架，分离可观察与不可观察状态，对比现有定义。

Result: 认为这些概念更依赖观察者的视角而非系统本身，群体行为定义应基于其生成过程。

Conclusion: 强调区分多机器人系统与真正群体的重要性，支持机器人群体系统的设计与部署。

Abstract: Emergence and swarms are widely discussed topics, yet no consensus exists on
their formal definitions. This lack of agreement makes it difficult not only
for new researchers to grasp these concepts, but also for experts who may use
the same terms to mean different things. Many attempts have been made to
objectively define 'swarm' or 'emergence,' with recent work highlighting the
role of the external observer. Still, several researchers argue that once an
observer's vantage point (e.g., scope, resolution, context) is established, the
terms can be made objective or measured quantitatively. In this note, we
propose a framework to discuss these ideas rigorously by separating externally
observable states from latent, unobservable ones. This allows us to compare and
contrast existing definitions of swarms and emergence on common ground. We
argue that these concepts are ultimately subjective-shaped less by the system
itself than by the perception and tacit knowledge of the observer.
Specifically, we suggest that a 'swarm' is not defined by its group behavior
alone, but by the process generating that behavior. Our broader goal is to
support the design and deployment of robotic swarm systems, highlighting the
critical distinction between multi-robot systems and true swarms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软体机器人的高度非线性和复杂行为使其运动学建模具有挑战性，现有数据驱动模型存在预测不确定性问题。

Method: 研究了多种线性和非线性机器学习模型，并开发了一种基于保形预测的框架，量化预测位置不确定性。

Result: 非线性集成方法表现出最稳健的泛化性能，保形预测框架提供了理论保证的预测区间。

Conclusion: 保形预测框架为软体机器人运动学建模提供了一种有效的量化不确定性的方法。

Abstract: Precise kinematic modeling is critical in calibration and controller design
for soft robots, yet remains a challenging issue due to their highly nonlinear
and complex behaviors. To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine
learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics.
However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively
affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling
in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and
real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine
learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The
results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust
generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling
framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify
predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction
intervals with a theoretical guarantee.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 比较g2o和Ceres求解器在Cartographer框架中提升扫描匹配性能的表现，发现Ceres在速度、收敛效率和地图清晰度上优于g2o，而g2o在局部障碍物检测中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估g2o和Ceres求解器在Cartographer中的性能差异，以优化SLAM的精度和效率。

Method: 在Cartographer框架中对比g2o和Ceres求解器的性能，使用AgileX LIMO机器人进行实验。

Result: Ceres在速度、收敛效率和地图清晰度上优于g2o，而g2o在局部障碍物检测中表现更佳。

Conclusion: Ceres更适合整体SLAM优化，而g2o在特定场景（如障碍物检测）中有优势。

Abstract: This article presents a comparative analysis of g2o and Ceres solvers in
enhancing scan matching performance within the Cartographer framework.
Cartographer, a widely-used library for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM), relies on optimization algorithms to refine pose estimates and improve
map accuracy. The research aims to evaluate the performance, efficiency, and
accuracy of the g2o solver in comparison to the Ceres solver, which is the
default in Cartographer. In our experiments comparing Ceres and g2o within
Cartographer, Ceres outperformed g2o in terms of speed, convergence efficiency,
and overall map clarity. Ceres required fewer iterations and less time to
converge, producing more accurate and well-defined maps, especially in
real-world mapping scenarios with the AgileX LIMO robot. However, g2o excelled
in localized obstacle detection, highlighting its value in specific situations.

### [4] [Self-Wearing Adaptive Garments via Soft Robotic Unfurling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07221)

Abstract: Robotic dressing assistance has the potential to improve the quality of life
for individuals with limited mobility. Existing solutions predominantly rely on
rigid robotic manipulators, which have challenges in handling deformable
garments and ensuring safe physical interaction with the human body. Prior
robotic dressing methods require excessive operation times, complex control
strategies, and constrained user postures, limiting their practicality and
adaptability. This paper proposes a novel soft robotic dressing system, the
Self-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which uses an unfurling and growth
mechanism to facilitate autonomous dressing. Unlike traditional approaches,the
SWAG conforms to the human body through an unfurling based deployment method,
eliminating skin-garment friction and enabling a safer and more efficient
dressing process. We present the working principles of the SWAG, introduce its
design and fabrication, and demonstrate its performance in dressing assistance.
The proposed system demonstrates effective garment application across various
garment configurations, presenting a promising alternative to conventional
robotic dressing assistance.

### [5] [3D Steering and Localization in Pipes and Burrows using an Externally Steered Soft Growing Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07225)
*Yimeng Qin,Jared Grinberg,William Heap,Allison M. Okamura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 介绍了一种可转向的藤蔓机器人，专为管道和洞穴环境设计，具有主动分支选择、小半径导航、尖锐转弯适应和实时3D定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有藤蔓机器人在人造和自然通道中导航困难，尤其是在有分支和尖锐3D转弯的环境中。

Result: 实现了最大51.7度的转向角、2.5厘米小半径管道导航、尖锐转弯适应以及实时3D定位。

Conclusion: 该机器人设计在复杂管道和洞穴环境中表现出优越的导航和适应能力。

Abstract: Navigation and inspection in confined environments, such as tunnels and
pipes, pose significant challenges for existing robots due to limitations in
maneuverability and adaptability to varying geometries. Vine robots, which are
soft growing continuum robots that extend their length through soft material
eversion at their tip, offer unique advantages due to their ability to navigate
tight spaces, adapt to complex paths, and minimize friction. However, existing
vine robot designs struggle with navigation in manmade and natural passageways,
with branches and sharp 3D turns. In this letter, we introduce a steerable vine
robot specifically designed for pipe and burrow environments. The robot
features a simple tubular body and an external tip mount that steers the vine
robot in three degrees of freedom by changing the growth direction and, when
necessary, bracing against the wall of the pipe or burrow. Our external tip
steering approach enables: (1) active branch selection in 3D space with a
maximum steerable angle of 51.7{\deg}, (2) navigation of pipe networks with
radii as small as 2.5 cm, (3) a compliant tip enabling navigation of sharp
turns, and (4) real-time 3D localization in GPS-denied environments using
tip-mounted sensors and continuum body odometry. We describe the forward
kinematics, characterize steerability, and demonstrate the system in a 3D pipe
system as well as a natural animal burrow.

### [6] [LangNavBench: Evaluation of Natural Language Understanding in Semantic Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07299)
*Sonia Raychaudhuri,Enrico Cancelli,Tommaso Campari,Lamberto Ballan,Manolis Savva,Angel X. Chang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LangNav是一个专注于语言理解的导航数据集，用于测试智能体对不同详细程度语言指令的响应能力。LangNavBench是该数据集的基准测试，用于系统评估导航模型的语言理解能力。提出的MLFM方法在LangNav上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航模型缺乏对语言指令的明确评估基准，LangNav填补了这一空白，旨在测试智能体对语言指令的响应能力。

Method: 提出LangNav数据集和LangNavBench基准测试，并开发了MLFM方法，该方法构建可查询的多层语义地图，特别适用于小物体或涉及空间关系的指令。

Result: MLFM在LangNav数据集上优于现有基于地图的导航基线方法。

Conclusion: LangNav和LangNavBench为语言驱动的导航提供了系统评估工具，MLFM方法在语言理解任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in
language-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target
object described in natural language. Despite these advances, we still lack a
clear, language-focused benchmark for testing how well such agents ground the
words in their instructions. We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set
dataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects
described at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine
attributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was
manually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and
semantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a
benchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand
and act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench
allows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes,
spatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first
thorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also
present Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable
multi-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small
objects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms
state-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset.

### [7] [Effects of Wrist-Worn Haptic Feedback on Force Accuracy and Task Speed during a Teleoperated Robotic Surgery Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07327)
*Brian B. Vuong,Josie Davidson,Sangheui Cheon,Kyujin Cho,Allison M. Okamura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了手腕触觉反馈在机器人辅助微创手术中的效果，发现其能显著降低力误差，但可能影响操作速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索手腕触觉反馈是否能在不干扰直接操作的情况下，有效提升手术中的力感知和任务表现。

Method: 使用软气动手腕触觉设备，参与者通过da Vinci手术机器人进行组织触诊任务，比较有无触觉反馈的表现。

Result: 手腕触觉反馈显著降低了力误差，但延长了操作时间。

Conclusion: 手腕触觉反馈有效，但需权衡速度与准确性。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that the addition of haptic feedback to the hands can
improve awareness of tool-tissue interactions and enhance performance of
teleoperated tasks in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However,
hand-based haptic feedback occludes direct interaction with the manipulanda of
surgeon console in teleoperated surgical robots. We propose relocating haptic
feedback to the wrist using a wearable haptic device so that haptic feedback
mechanisms do not need to be integrated into the manipulanda. However, it is
unknown if such feedback will be effective, given that it is not co-located
with the finger movements used for manipulation. To test if relocated haptic
feedback improves force application during teleoperated tasks using da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot, participants learned to palpate a phantom
tissue to desired forces. A soft pneumatic wrist-worn haptic device with an
anchoring system renders tool-tissue interaction forces to the wrist of the
user. Participants performed the palpation task with and without wrist-worn
haptic feedback and were evaluated for the accuracy of applied forces.
Participants demonstrated statistically significant lower force error when
wrist-worn haptic feedback was provided. Participants also performed the
palpation task with longer movement times when provided wrist-worn haptic
feedback, indicating that the haptic feedback may have caused participants to
operate at a different point in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve.

### [8] [UniTracker: Learning Universal Whole-Body Motion Tracker for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07356)
*Kangning Yin,Weishuai Zeng,Ke Fan,Zirui Wang,Qiang Zhang,Zheng Tian,Jingbo Wang,Jiangmiao Pang,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniTracker框架通过集成CVAE显式建模人类动作的潜在多样性，显著提升了人形机器人的动作质量、泛化能力和部署鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于师生框架的方法在策略蒸馏中丢失动作多样性及泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: 提出UniTracker框架，将CVAE集成到学生策略中，利用学习的CVAE先验显式建模动作多样性。

Result: 在仿真和实际部署中，UniTracker在动作质量、泛化能力和鲁棒性上显著优于MLP-based DAgger基线。

Conclusion: UniTracker为表达性人形控制提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Humanoid robots must achieve diverse, robust, and generalizable whole-body
control to operate effectively in complex, human-centric environments. However,
existing methods, particularly those based on teacher-student frameworks often
suffer from a loss of motion diversity during policy distillation and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen behaviors. In this work, we present
UniTracker, a simplified yet powerful framework that integrates a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) into the student policy to explicitly model the
latent diversity of human motion. By leveraging a learned CVAE prior, our
method enables the student to retain expressive motion characteristics while
improving robustness and adaptability under partial observations. The result is
a single policy capable of tracking a wide spectrum of whole-body motions with
high fidelity and stability. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world deployments demonstrate that UniTracker significantly outperforms
MLP-based DAgger baselines in motion quality, generalization to unseen
references, and deployment robustness, offering a practical and scalable
solution for expressive humanoid control.

### [9] [PILOC: A Pheromone Inverse Guidance Mechanism and Local-Communication Framework for Dynamic Target Search of Multi-Agent in Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07376)
*Hengrui Liu,Yi Feng,Qilong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PILOC框架通过局部感知和通信，结合信息素逆向引导机制，提升多智能体搜索救援的效率、适应性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态和未知环境中的目标不可预测性和环境不确定性给多智能体搜索救援带来挑战。

Method: 提出PILOC框架，利用局部感知和通信，引入信息素逆向引导机制，并将其嵌入深度强化学习的观察空间。

Result: 实验表明，PILOC在动态和通信受限场景下表现优于现有方法，显著提升搜索效率和系统鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PILOC为未来多智能体搜索救援应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR) plays a vital role in disaster
response, exploration, and reconnaissance. However, dynamic and unknown
environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and
environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a
framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local
perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance
mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization.
PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication,
significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional
heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based
on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based
multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that
combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly
boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to
existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and
communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future
MASAR applications.

### [10] [Towards Safe Autonomous Driving: A Real-Time Safeguarding Concept for Motion Planning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07444)
*Korbinian Moller,Rafael Neher,Marvin Seegert,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于自动驾驶运动规划的时间保护机制，扩展了现有方法，确保实时性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂或基于学习的运动规划模块在实时嵌入式环境中的功能安全问题。

Method: 引入时间保护机制，结合几何、动态和时间一致性检查，原型在实时操作系统上实现。

Result: 初步结果显示保护模块在实时范围内运行，能有效检测不安全轨迹。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个模块化、可扩展的运行时轨迹验证框架，未来工作包括完善保护逻辑和硬件验证。

Abstract: Ensuring the functional safety of motion planning modules in autonomous
vehicles remains a critical challenge, especially when dealing with complex or
learning-based software. Online verification has emerged as a promising
approach to monitor such systems at runtime, yet its integration into embedded
real-time environments remains limited. This work presents a safeguarding
concept for motion planning that extends prior approaches by introducing a time
safeguard. While existing methods focus on geometric and dynamic feasibility,
our approach additionally monitors the temporal consistency of planning outputs
to ensure timely system response. A prototypical implementation on a real-time
operating system evaluates trajectory candidates using constraint-based
feasibility checks and cost-based plausibility metrics. Preliminary results
show that the safeguarding module operates within real-time bounds and
effectively detects unsafe trajectories. However, the full integration of the
time safeguard logic and fallback strategies is ongoing. This study contributes
a modular and extensible framework for runtime trajectory verification and
highlights key aspects for deployment on automotive-grade hardware. Future work
includes completing the safeguarding logic and validating its effectiveness
through hardware-in-the-loop simulations and vehicle-based testing. The code is

### [11] [SCREP: Scene Coordinate Regression and Evidential Learning-based Perception-Aware Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07467)
*Juyeop Han,Lukas Lao Beyer,Guilherme V. Cavalheiro,Sertac Karaman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合场景坐标回归（SCR）和轨迹优化的感知感知框架，用于GPS缺失环境中的自主飞行，显著降低了定位误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GPS缺失的室内环境中，需要确保视觉定位误差在多种任务中保持低水平，而传统的视觉惯性里程计（VIO）会随时间累积漂移。

Method: 结合基于证据学习的SCR姿态估计器和后退水平轨迹优化器，优化器引导摄像头朝向不确定性低的像素，同时固定滞后平滑器融合SCR和IMU数据。

Result: 仿真中，该方法将平移和旋转的平均误差分别降低了54%/15%和40%/31%，硬件实验验证了其可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了GPS缺失环境中的自主飞行问题，显著提升了定位精度和实时性。

Abstract: Autonomous flight in GPS denied indoor spaces requires trajectories that keep
visual localization error tightly bounded across varied missions. Whereas
visual inertial odometry (VIO) accumulates drift over time, scene coordinate
regression (SCR) yields drift-free, high accuracy absolute pose estimation. We
present a perception-aware framework that couples an evidential learning-based
SCR pose estimator with a receding horizon trajectory optimizer. The optimizer
steers the onboard camera toward pixels whose uncertainty predicts reliable
scene coordinates, while a fixed-lag smoother fuses the low rate SCR stream
with high rate IMU data to close the perception control loop in real time. In
simulation, our planner reduces translation (rotation) mean error by 54% / 15%
(40% / 31%) relative to yaw fixed and forward-looking baselines, respectively.
Moreover, hardware in the loop experiment validates the feasibility of our
proposed framework.

Method: 设计了一种基于微型倒置Delta机器人的3D可穿戴触觉设备FiDTouch，提供接触、压力、皮肤拉伸和振动反馈。

Result: 用户研究表明，FiDTouch能有效感知静态空间接触和皮肤拉伸刺激，提升交互沉浸感和效率。

Conclusion: FiDTouch通过精确触觉反馈，为人机交互和机器人操作提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The applications of fingertip haptic devices have spread to various fields
from revolutionizing virtual reality and medical training simulations to
facilitating remote robotic operations, proposing great potential for enhancing
user experiences, improving training outcomes, and new forms of interaction. In
this work, we present FiDTouch, a 3D wearable haptic device that delivers
cutaneous stimuli to the finger pad, such as contact, pressure, encounter, skin
stretch, and vibrotactile feedback. The application of a tiny inverted Delta
robot in the mechanism design allows providing accurate contact and fast
changing dynamic stimuli to the finger pad surface. The performance of the
developed display was evaluated in a two-stage user study of the perception of
static spatial contact stimuli and skin stretch stimuli generated on the finger
pad. The proposed display, by providing users with precise touch and force
stimuli, can enhance user immersion and efficiency in the fields of
human-computer and human-robot interactions.

### [13] [Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models-based Anomaly Detection for under-constrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07714)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯混合模型（GMM）的自适应无监督异常检测算法，仅利用电机扭矩数据检测电缆驱动并联机器人（CDPRs）的异常，无需额外传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CDPRs的负载操作任务中，需要在固定姿态下检测异常（如风或电缆碰撞），以确保安全。现有方法依赖额外传感器，本文探索仅用扭矩数据实现检测的可能性。

Method: 通过短时间校准拟合GMM模型，实时计算马氏距离并设定统计阈值触发异常标志。模型参数定期更新以适应环境变化。

Conclusion: 该方法在无额外传感器下高效检测异常，适应性强，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load
manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At
each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the
cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by
detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or
cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using
only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,
unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a
brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on
known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using
Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds
triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the
latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions.
Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind
intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4%
average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative
evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates
higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

Abstract: The integration of high-level assistance algorithms in surgical robotics
training curricula may be beneficial in establishing a more comprehensive and
robust skillset for aspiring surgeons, improving their clinical performance as
a consequence. This work presents the development and validation of a
haptic-enhanced Virtual Reality simulator for surgical robotics training,
featuring 8 surgical tasks that the trainee can interact with thanks to the
embedded physics engine. This virtual simulated environment is augmented by the
introduction of high-level haptic interfaces for robotic assistance that aim at
re-directing the motion of the trainee's hands and wrists toward targets or
away from obstacles, and providing a quantitative performance score after the
execution of each training exercise.An experimental study shows that the
introduction of enhanced robotic assistance into a surgical robotics training
curriculum improves performance during the training process and, crucially,
promotes the transfer of the acquired skills to an unassisted surgical
scenario, like the clinical one.

Abstract: Robot swarms offer the potential to serve a variety of distributed sensing
applications. An interesting real-world application that stands to benefit
significantly from deployment of swarms is structural monitoring, where
traditional sensor networks face challenges in structural coverage due to their
static nature. This paper investigates the deployment of a swarm of
miniaturized vibration sensing robots to inspect and localize structural
damages on a surface section within a high-fidelity simulation environment. In
particular, we consider a 1 m x 1 m x 3 mm steel surface section and utilize
finite element analysis using Abaqus to obtain realistic structural vibration
data. The resulting vibration data is imported into the physics-based robotic
simulator Webots, where we simulate the dynamics of our surface inspecting
robot swarm. We employ (i) Gaussian process estimators to guide the robots'
exploration as they collect vibration samples across the surface and (ii)
operational modal analysis to detect structural damages by estimating and
comparing existing and intact structural vibration patterns. We analyze the
influence of exploration radii on estimation uncertainty and assess the
effectiveness of our method across 10 randomized scenarios, where the number,
locations, surface area, and depth of structural damages vary. Our simulation
studies validate the efficacy of our miniaturized robot swarm for
vibration-based structural inspection.

Result: 通过LLMs替代传统监督学习或分析方法，提高了方法的实际应用性和可部署性。

Conclusion: LLMs在分类和分割复杂动作方面具有潜力，为实际场景中的任务编码提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite their recent introduction to human society, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have significantly affected the way we tackle mental challenges in our
everyday lives. From optimizing our linguistic communication to assisting us in
making important decisions, LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are notably reducing our
cognitive load by gradually taking on an increasing share of our mental
activities. In the context of Learning by Demonstration (LbD), classifying and
segmenting complex motions into primitive actions, such as pushing, pulling,
twisting etc, is considered to be a key-step towards encoding a task. In this
work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to undertake this task,
considering a finite set of predefined primitive actions found in fruit picking
operations. By utilizing LLMs instead of simple supervised learning or analytic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于特征的SLAM系统因固定前端参数，对光照变化敏感，导致性能下降。IRAF-SLAM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 图像增强预处理；2. 基于图像熵、像素强度和梯度分析的动态特征提取；3. 通过密度分布分析和光照影响因子筛选不可靠特征点。

Result: 在TUM-VI和EuRoC数据集上，IRAF-SLAM显著减少了跟踪失败，轨迹精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自适应前端策略能有效提升vSLAM的鲁棒性，且计算开销可控。

Abstract: Robust Visual SLAM (vSLAM) is essential for autonomous systems operating in
real-world environments, where challenges such as dynamic objects, low texture,
and critically, varying illumination conditions often degrade performance.
Existing feature-based SLAM systems rely on fixed front-end parameters, making
them vulnerable to sudden lighting changes and unstable feature tracking. To
address these challenges, we propose ``IRAF-SLAM'', an Illumination-Robust and
Adaptive Feature-Culling front-end designed to enhance vSLAM resilience in
complex and challenging environments. Our approach introduces: (1) an image
enhancement scheme to preprocess and adjust image quality under varying
lighting conditions; (2) an adaptive feature extraction mechanism that
dynamically adjusts detection sensitivity based on image entropy, pixel
intensity, and gradient analysis; and (3) a feature culling strategy that
filters out unreliable feature points using density distribution analysis and a
lighting impact factor. Comprehensive evaluations on the TUM-VI and European
Robotics Challenge (EuRoC) datasets demonstrate that IRAF-SLAM significantly
reduces tracking failures and achieves superior trajectory accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art vSLAM methods under adverse illumination conditions. These
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive front-end strategies in
improving vSLAM robustness without incurring significant computational
overhead. The implementation of IRAF-SLAM is publicly available at

*Zhe Han,Huanyu Tian,Tom Vercauteren,Da Liu,Changsheng Li,Xingguang Duan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机协作系统，用于在术前计划和外科医生指导下进行下颌角劈开截骨术（MASO），通过任务分解和光学跟踪系统提高手术精确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管技术和器械有所进步，MASO的成功仍高度依赖外科医生的经验，因此需要一种更精确和安全的方法。

Method: 将手术过程分解为三个子任务：机器人主导的位置和方向控制，以及外科医生主导的力控制；使用光学跟踪系统（OTS）实现患者追踪。

Result: 在真实模型上的钻孔实验显示，计划与实际钻孔点的平均误差为1.85mm。

Conclusion: 该系统通过人机协作和光学跟踪，显著提高了MASO的精确性和安全性。

Abstract: Mandibular Angle Split Osteotomy (MASO) is a significant procedure in oral
and maxillofacial surgery. Despite advances in technique and instrumentation,
its success still relies heavily on the surgeon's experience. In this work, a
human-robot collaborative system is proposed to perform MASO according to a
preoperative plan and under guidance of a surgeon. A task decomposition
methodology is used to divide the collaborative surgical procedure into three
subtasks: (1) positional control and (2) orientation control, both led by the
robot for precise alignment; and (3) force-control, managed by surgeon to
ensure safety. Additionally, to achieve patient tracking without the need for a
skull clamp, an optical tracking system (OTS) is utilized. Movement of the
patient mandibular is measured with an optical-based tracker mounted on a
dental occlusal splint. A registration method and Robot-OTS calibration method
are introduced to achieve reliable navigation within our framework. The
experiments of drilling were conducted on the realistic phantom model, which
demonstrated that the average error between the planned and actual drilling
points is 1.85mm.

Motivation: 解决四足机器人在未知动态负载下的建模、感知和交互问题。

Method: 提出负载特性建模方法，结合强化学习控制，实现负载动态推断和稳定。

Result: 在突加载荷抵抗、负载稳定和复杂地形重载运动方面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 方法有效且优越，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: Unknown dynamic load carrying is one important practical application for
quadruped robots. Such a problem is non-trivial, posing three major challenges
in quadruped locomotion control. First, how to model or represent the dynamics
of the load in a generic manner. Second, how to make the robot capture the
dynamics without any external sensing. Third, how to enable the robot to
interact with load handling the mutual effect and stabilizing the load. In this
work, we propose a general load modeling approach called load characteristics
modeling to capture the dynamics of the load. We integrate this proposed
modeling technique and leverage recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL)
based locomotion control to enable the robot to infer the dynamics of load
movement and interact with the load indirectly to stabilize it and realize the
sim-to-real deployment to verify its effectiveness in real scenarios. We
conduct extensive comparative simulation experiments to validate the
effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Results show that our
method outperforms other methods in sudden load resistance, load stabilizing
and locomotion with heavy load on rough terrain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感知失真如何影响自主机器人的内部世界表示，以及如何通过最小化系统实现自主导航学习。

Method: 使用配备距离传感器和指南针的模拟两轮机器人，在简单方形环境中随机探索，分析其传感器数据。

Result: 发现尽管感知空间存在失真，但仍能涌现出与物理环境相关的结构，机器人无需显式空间信息即可学习导航表示。

Conclusion: 研究为具身认知、最小代理及感知在人工生命导航策略中的作用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Autonomous agents, particularly in the field of robotics, rely on sensory
information to perceive and navigate their environment. However, these sensory
inputs are often imperfect, leading to distortions in the agent's internal
representation of the world. This paper investigates the nature of these
perceptual distortions and how they influence autonomous representation
learning using a minimal robotic system. We utilize a simulated two-wheeled
robot equipped with distance sensors and a compass, operating within a simple
square environment. Through analysis of the robot's sensor data during random
exploration, we demonstrate how a distorted perceptual space emerges. Despite
these distortions, we identify emergent structures within the perceptual space
that correlate with the physical environment, revealing how the robot
autonomously learns a structured representation for navigation without explicit
spatial information. This work contributes to the understanding of embodied
cognition, minimal agency, and the role of perception in self-generated
navigation strategies in artificial life.

Abstract: As the robotics systems increasingly integrate into daily life, from smart
home assistants to the new-wave of industrial automation systems (Industry
4.0), there's an increasing need to bridge the gap between complex robotic
systems and everyday users. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible
framework often utilised in writing robot software, providing tools and
libraries for building complex robotic systems. However, ROS's distributed
architecture and technical messaging system create barriers for understanding
robot status and diagnosing errors. This gap can lead to extended maintenance
downtimes, as users with limited ROS knowledge may struggle to quickly diagnose
and resolve system issues. Moreover, this deficit in expertise often delays
proactive maintenance and troubleshooting, further increasing the frequency and
duration of system interruptions. ROS Help Desk provides intuitive error
explanations and debugging support, dynamically customized to users of varying
expertise levels. It features user-centric debugging tools that simplify error
diagnosis, implements proactive error detection capabilities to reduce
downtime, and integrates multimodal data processing for comprehensive system
state understanding across multi-sensor data (e.g., lidar, RGB). Testing
qualitatively and quantitatively with artificially induced errors demonstrates
the system's ability to proactively and accurately diagnose problems,
ultimately reducing maintenance time and fostering more effective human-robot
collaboration.

### [22] [Improving AEBS Validation Through Objective Intervention Classification Leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07872)
*Daniel Betschinske,Steven Peters*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于规则的方法（PDP）用于区分自动紧急制动系统（AEBS）的误报和真报，以减少人为标注的主观性，提高验证的透明度和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖主观人为标注，可能引入偏见和局限性，需更客观的分类方法。

Method: 采用基于预测分歧原则（PDP）的规则分类方法，分析简化AEBS的激活情况。

Result: 该方法揭示了关键优势、局限性和系统需求，结合人为标注可提升分类透明度和一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为AEBS验证提供了更可靠和可重复的框架，未来可进一步优化和扩展。

Abstract: The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires
accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP)
system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by
comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from
open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) -
is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and
the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is
frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments
of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing
biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach
leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues.
Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths,
limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings
suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the
transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall
validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work
adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for
refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the
potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for
more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数商用机器人缺乏触觉皮肤，难以实现基本触觉功能，如接触定位。UniTac旨在普及触觉感知，为HRI研究者提供现成工具。

Method: 利用数据驱动方法，仅依赖关节传感器实现接触定位，无需安装额外传感器。

Result: 在Franka机械臂和Spot四足机器人上验证，接触定位精度分别为8.0厘米和7.2厘米，频率达2000Hz。

Conclusion: UniTac为机器人触觉感知提供了一种低成本、高效的解决方案，适用于多种平台。

Abstract: Robots can better interact with humans and unstructured environments through
touch sensing. However, most commercial robots are not equipped with tactile
skins, making it challenging to achieve even basic touch-sensing functions,
such as contact localization. We present UniTac, a data-driven whole-body
touch-sensing approach that uses only proprioceptive joint sensors and does not
require the installation of additional sensors. Our approach enables a robot
equipped solely with joint sensors to localize contacts. Our goal is to
democratize touch sensing and provide an off-the-shelf tool for HRI researchers
to provide their robots with touch-sensing capabilities. We validate our
approach on two platforms: the Franka robot arm and the Spot quadruped. On
Franka, we can localize contact to within 8.0 centimeters, and on Spot, we can
localize to within 7.2 centimeters at around 2,000 Hz on an RTX 3090 GPU
without adding any additional sensors to the robot. Project website:
