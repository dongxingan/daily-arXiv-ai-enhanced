### [1] [Learning Fast, Tool aware Collision Avoidance for Collaborative Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20457)
*Joonho Lee,Yunho Kim,Seokjoon Kim,Quan Nguyen,Youngjin Heo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 一种基于强化学习的工具感知碰撞避免系统，能够在动态环境中实时调整工具大小和交互模式，并在部分可观测情况下预测碰撞风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人控制器假设完全可观测和固定工具，在动态环境中容易导致碰撞或行为保守，需要更智能的碰撞避免方案

Method: 使用学习的感知模型过滤点云中的机器人和工具部件，推理遮挡区域，预测部分可观测情况下的碰撞风险，并通过约束强化学习训练控制策略

Result: 在模拟和实际测试中表现超过传统方法(APF, MPPI)，保持毫米级精度，计算成本比GPU基础规划器约低60%，响应时间在10毫秒以内

Conclusion: 该方法为动态环境中的协作机器人提供了模块化、高效和有效的碰撞避免能力，实现了安全和灵敏的操作

Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human
environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle
motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume
full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly
conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision
avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of
tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system
filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about
occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use
a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce
smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and
real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI)
in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover,
our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to
a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient,
and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments.
We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate
its practical use for safe and responsive operation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPGrasp是一个基于SAMv2的实时动态抓取合成框架，通过集成用户提示和时空上下文，实现59ms的低延迟推理，在多个数据集上达到90%以上的抓取准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有动态物体实时交互抓取方法在低延迟推理和提示能力之间的权衡问题，实现真正实时的交互式抓取。

Method: 扩展SAMv2模型，集成用户提示与时空上下文信息，确保动态物体的时间一致性，实现端到端的低延迟抓取估计。

Result: 在OCID数据集上达到90.6%的实例级抓取准确率，Jacquard数据集上93.8%，GraspNet-1Billion连续跟踪任务中达到92.0%准确率，延迟仅73.1ms，比现有最佳方法延迟降低58.5%。真实世界实验中13个移动物体的交互抓取成功率达到94.8%。

Conclusion: SPGrasp有效解决了动态抓取合成中的延迟-交互性权衡问题，实现了高性能的实时交互式抓取。

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in
interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively
resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code

### [3] [SimShear: Sim-to-Real Shear-based Tactile Servoing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20561)
*Kipp McAdam Freud,Yijiong Lin,Nathan F. Lepora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimShear是一个从仿真到现实的触觉控制管道，通过shPix2pix GAN将无剪切信息的仿真触觉图像转换为包含剪切变形的真实图像，成功应用于桌面机械臂的触觉跟踪和协作举升任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪切信息对于涉及动态物体交互的任务至关重要，但由于剪切动力学难以在仿真中精确建模，这限制了仿真到现实触觉控制的应用。

Method: 提出shPix2pix（剪切条件U-Net GAN），将无剪切信息的仿真触觉图像与剪切编码向量结合，生成包含剪切变形的真实触觉图像。使用低成本桌面机械臂和视觉触觉传感器验证方法。

Result: 在触觉图像仿真和位姿/剪切预测方面优于基线pix2pix方法。在触觉跟踪和协作举升任务中，接触误差保持在1-2毫米范围内。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了使用刚体仿真器进行仿真到现实剪切建模的可行性，为触觉机器人仿真开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that enables
the use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in
simulation. Shear, arising from lateral movements across contact surfaces, is
critical for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but remains
challenging to simulate. To address this, we introduce shPix2pix, a
shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated tactile images absent of
shear, together with a vector encoding shear information, into realistic
equivalents with shear deformations. This method outperforms baseline pix2pix
approaches in simulating tactile images and in pose/shear prediction. We apply
SimShear to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms
equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: (i) a tactile tracking task, where
a follower arm tracks a surface moved by a leader arm, and (ii) a collaborative
co-lifting task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader
follows a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintains contact errors within 1
to 2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential, validating
the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators and
opening new directions for simulation in tactile robotics.

### [4] [Traversing the Narrow Path: A Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning Framework for Humanoid Beam Walking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20661)
*TianChen Huang,Wei Gao,Runchen Xu,Shiwu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段框架，结合XCoM/LIPM步态模板与轻量级残差规划器，使人形机器人能够可靠地穿越窄梁。第一阶段在平地上训练跟踪器，第二阶段在梁上训练高层规划器进行残差修正，实现了高成功率和安全的窄梁穿越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人在窄梁上行走的挑战，包括稀疏的安全关键接触点和纯学习策略的脆弱性，需要一个物理基础且鲁棒的方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段在平地上训练跟踪器学习稳定接触调度和目标跟踪鲁棒性；第二阶段在模拟梁上训练高层规划器，仅对摆动脚预测身体坐标系残差(Δx, Δy, Δψ)，细化模板步态以实现精确安全的落脚点放置。

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上成功穿越0.2米宽、3米长的梁。在模拟和真实世界实验中，残差细化方法在成功率、中心线遵循度和安全裕度方面 consistently优于仅使用模板和整体基线方法。

Conclusion: 该结构化步态接口实现了透明分析和低摩擦的模拟到真实转移，证明了物理基础的两阶段方法在窄梁穿越任务中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse,
safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We
propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM
footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level
tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly
follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic
footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable
contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in
simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual
(Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template
step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while
preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and
consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,
forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a
Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across
simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms
template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence,
and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent
analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业元宇宙中实时人机交互面临高计算负载、有限带宽和严格延迟等挑战，需要解决响应式交互问题

Result: 在轨迹绘制控制任务中将加权RMSE从0.0712m降低到0.0101m；在核退役3D场景表示任务中达到PSNR 22.11、SSIM 0.8729、LPIPS 0.1298

Conclusion: 该框架能够在实时高风险工业环境中确保空间精度和视觉保真度，证明了其有效性

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,
high-risk industrial environments.

Result: 在3自由度书法机器人上评估了所提出的系统

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够实现根据人类意图灵活改变任务的技能转移，为解决熟练工人减少问题提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal
with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been
researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called
imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data,
but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and
reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the
framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning
methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change
tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by
conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible
motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The
proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and
skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF
calligraphy robot.

Abstract: Enabling multiple autonomous machines to perform reliably requires the
development of efficient cooperative control algorithms. This paper presents a
survey of algorithms that have been developed for controlling and coordinating
autonomous machines in complex environments. We especially focus on task
allocation methods using computational intelligence (CI) and deep reinforcement
learning (RL). The advantages and disadvantages of the surveyed methods are
analysed thoroughly. We also propose and discuss in detail various future
research directions that shed light on how to improve existing algorithms or
create new methods to enhance the employability and performance of autonomous
machines in real-world applications. The findings indicate that CI and deep RL
methods provide viable approaches to addressing complex task allocation
problems in dynamic and uncertain environments. The recent development of deep
RL has greatly contributed to the literature on controlling and coordinating
autonomous machines, and it has become a growing trend in this area. It is
envisaged that this paper will provide researchers and engineers with a
comprehensive overview of progress in machine learning research related to
autonomous machines. It also highlights underexplored areas, identifies
emerging methodologies, and suggests new avenues for exploration in future
research within this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人机协作中安全保证与响应性行为之间的冲突，避免传统方法因过度保守而导致的不必要制动和任务停滞

Method: 不确定性感知预测控制屏障函数(UA-PCBFs)，融合概率性人体运动预测和不确定性估计，动态调整安全边界

Result: 在真实世界实验中表现优于现有HRI架构，显著减少了机器人安全空间违规次数

Conclusion: UA-PCBFs框架为人机协作提供了更智能、更流畅的交互方式，通过不确定性感知实现了安全性与灵活性的更好平衡

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fabric-based thermal-haptic interface for virtual
reality and teleoperation. It integrates pneumatic actuation and conductive
fabric with an innovative ultra-lightweight design, achieving only 2~g for each
finger unit. By embedding heating elements within textile pneumatic chambers,
the system delivers modulated pressure and thermal stimuli to fingerpads
through a fully soft, wearable interface.
  Comprehensive characterization demonstrates rapid thermal modulation with
heating rates up to 3$^{\circ}$C/s, enabling dynamic thermal feedback for
virtual or teleoperation interactions. The pneumatic subsystem generates forces
up to 8.93~N at 50~kPa, while optimization of fingerpad-actuator clearance
enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental
validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature
identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and
significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks.
Results show enhanced success rates (88.5\% to 96.4\%, p = 0.029) and improved
force control precision (p = 0.013) when haptic feedback is enabled, validating
the effectiveness of the integrated thermal-haptic approach for advanced
human-machine interaction applications.

Abstract: In a recent effort, we successfully proposed a categorically novel approach
to mimic the phenomenoa of hovering and source seeking by flapping insects and
hummingbirds using a new extremum seeking control (ESC) approach. Said ESC
approach was shown capable of characterizing the physics of hovering and source
seeking by flapping systems, providing at the same time uniquely novel
opportunity for a model-free, real-time biomimicry control design. In this
paper, we experimentally test and verify, for the first time in the literature,
the potential of ESC in flapping robots to achieve model-free, real-time
controlled hovering and source seeking. The results of this paper, while being
restricted to 1D, confirm the premise of introducing ESC as a natural control
method and biomimicry mechanism to the field of flapping flight and robotics.

Conclusion: 带动了向可扩展、可解释和通用体验智能的发展。

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Result: GIT*在R^4到R^16维度问题上超越了现有的单查询采样规划器，并在真实移动操作任务中验证了有效性

Conclusion: 通过整合多种环境数据和强化遗传编程，GIT*显著提高了路径规划的效率和解决方案质量

Abstract: Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a
start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic
functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve
search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook
available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the
complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed
Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a
wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and
the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better
guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP),
which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate
genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of
data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality
within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses
existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to
R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task. A video

Abstract: Efficient motion planning algorithms are essential in robotics. Optimizing
essential parameters, such as batch size and nearest neighbor selection in
sampling-based methods, can enhance performance in the planning process.
However, existing approaches often lack environmental adaptability. Inspired by
the method of the deep fuzzy neural networks, this work introduces
Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based deep fuzzy
learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor
parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding
both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates
between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths
and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces
demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution
quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, sampling-based planners
in environments ranging from R^8 to R^14 and is successfully validated on a
dual-arm robot manipulation task. A video showcasing our experimental results

updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and
reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,
the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against
data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot
collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in
significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total
bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These
benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming
data, and time-varying network topologies.

Conclusion: 该框架为机器人在复杂非结构化环境中高效搜索物体提供了可行的解决方案，通过语言增强的层次化导航实现了语义感知与空间推理的紧密集成

Abstract: Enabling robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in complex,
unstructured environments is critical for diverse applications ranging from
household assistance to industrial automation. However, traditional scene
representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable
contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in
completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a
language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates
semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented
Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large
language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process
through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved
through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each
stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we
introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting
with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.
Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search
efficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies. Website

Abstract: As space exploration advances, underground environments are becoming
increasingly attractive due to their potential to provide shelter, easier
access to resources, and enhanced scientific opportunities. Although such
environments exist on Earth, they are often not easily accessible and do not
accurately represent the diversity of underground environments found throughout
the solar system. This paper presents PLUME, a procedural generation framework
aimed at easily creating 3D underground environments. Its flexible structure
allows for the continuous enhancement of various underground features, aligning
with our expanding understanding of the solar system. The environments
generated using PLUME can be used for AI training, evaluating robotics
algorithms, 3D rendering, and facilitating rapid iteration on developed
exploration algorithms. In this paper, it is demonstrated that PLUME has been
used along with a robotic simulator. PLUME is open source and has been released
on Github. https://github.com/Gabryss/P.L.U.M.E

Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant
challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system
reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome
these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with
custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3%
through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel,
daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common
wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based
systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels
across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS,
confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's
efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's
open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that
slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the
robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully
manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a
robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced
whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定位系统假设所有视角都同样有效，但实际上某些视角可能包含未映射、模糊或无信息区域，导致定位不可靠

Method: 使用大规模训练的基于注意力的模型，编码度量地图和建图时的相机位姿，预测任意3D位置在不同偏航和俯仰角度下的定位精度分布，并将其整合到路径规划器中

Result: 在单视角选择和完整轨迹规划任务上达到了最先进的性能，能够有效提升定位鲁棒性

Conclusion: ActLoc的模块化设计使其适用于各种机器人导航和检测任务，通过主动选择信息丰富的视角来显著提高定位可靠性

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are
incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac,
an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing
through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural
components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities.
Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional
visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing
modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile
feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to
achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate
three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$),
material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material
dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task.
Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to
concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which
verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise
robotic manipulation.

Abstract: With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring
soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or
other machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such
interactions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow
torque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while
accurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic
programming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on
accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model
mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce
Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,
probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,
without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's
proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a
prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the
unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator
driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden
changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in
static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario
where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and
dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to
changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory
system.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and
whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid
interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis
exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must
perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both
agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for
humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory
prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based
whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and
timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that
mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive
rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are
incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose
humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and
sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate
real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a
step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.

the barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from
imaginative ideas.

Abstract: Learning control policies in simulation enables rapid, safe, and
cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However,
transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the
sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can
degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization
and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle
under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In
this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of
relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly
adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve
this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies
residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a
differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework
refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled
effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics
model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient
backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy
updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of
our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to
unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on
agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the
real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to
L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in
vision-based control without explicit state estimation.
