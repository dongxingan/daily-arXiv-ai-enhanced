Traditional model-based\ntechniques, such as game-theoretic methods and robust control, are often overly\nconservative or computationally intensive. Conversely, learning-based\napproaches typically require extensive training data and frequently exhibit\nlimited interpretability and generalizability. Simpler strategies, such as Risk\nPotential Fields (RPF), provide lightweight alternatives with minimal data\ndemands but are inherently static and struggle to adapt effectively to dynamic\ntraffic conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Evolutionary\nRisk Potential Field (ERPF), a novel approach that dynamically updates risk\nassessments in dynamical scenarios based on historical obstacle proximity data.\nWe introduce a Risk-Ellipse construct that combines longitudinal reach and\nlateral uncertainty into a unified spatial temporal collision envelope.\nAdditionally, we define an adaptive Evolution Factor metric, computed through\nsigmoid normalization of Time to Collision (TTC) and Time-Window-of-Hazard\n(TWH), which dynamically adjusts the dimensions of the ellipse axes in real\ntime. This adaptive risk metric is integrated seamlessly into a Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) framework, enabling autonomous vehicles to proactively\naddress complex interactive driving scenarios in terms of uncertain driving of\nsurrounding vehicles. Comprehensive comparative experiments demonstrate that\nour ERPF-MPC approach consistently achieves smoother trajectories, higher\naverage speeds, and collision-free navigation, offering a robust and adaptive\nsolution suitable for complex interactive driving environments."}
