### [1] [Research on UAV Applications in Public Administration: Based on an Improved RRT Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14096)
*Zhanxi Xie,Baili Lu,Yanzhao Gu,Zikun Li,Junhao Wei,Ngai Cheong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究提出改进的dRRT算法，通过四种策略优化无人机路径规划，在模拟城市环境中相比传统算法表现更优，成功率达100%，运行时间更短，路径更平滑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机从'技术工具'向'治理基础设施'转型，低空经济政策和智慧城市需求推动下，高效的路径规划对无人机在公共管理中的应用变得至关重要。

Method: 提出增强型快速探索随机树算法(dRRT)，包含四种策略：目标偏向加速收敛、动态步长平衡探索与避障、绕行优先选择水平绕行而非垂直爬升、B样条平滑提升路径平滑度。

Result: 在500立方米城市环境模拟中，dRRT相比传统RRT、A*和蚁群算法表现更优：100%成功率、平均运行时间0.01468秒、更短路径、更少航点、更平滑轨迹（最大偏航角<45度）。

Conclusion: dRRT在公共管理场景如应急响应和交通监控中具有高效部署潜力，但需要与实时避障框架集成，并存在计算开销增加和目标偏向可能导致局部最优的局限性。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
public management, focusing on optimizing path planning to address challenges
such as energy consumption, obstacle avoidance, and airspace constraints. As
UAVs transition from 'technical tools' to 'governance infrastructure', driven
by advancements in low-altitude economy policies and smart city demands,
efficient path planning becomes critical. The research proposes an enhanced
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (dRRT), incorporating four strategies:
Target Bias (to accelerate convergence), Dynamic Step Size (to balance
exploration and obstacle navigation), Detour Priority (to prioritize horizontal
detours over vertical ascents), and B-spline smoothing (to enhance path
smoothness). Simulations in a 500 m3 urban environment with randomized
buildings demonstrate dRRT's superiority over traditional RRT, A*, and Ant
Colony Optimization (ACO). Results show dRRT achieves a 100\% success rate with
an average runtime of 0.01468s, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and
smoother trajectories (maximum yaw angles <45{\deg}). Despite improvements,
limitations include increased computational overhead from added mechanisms and
potential local optima due to goal biasing. The study highlights dRRT's
potential for efficient UAV deployment in public management scenarios like
emergency response and traffic monitoring, while underscoring the need for
integration with real-time obstacle avoidance frameworks. This work contributes
to interdisciplinary advancements in urban governance, robotics, and
computational optimization.

### [2] [No More Marching: Learning Humanoid Locomotion for Short-Range SE(2) Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14098)
*Pranay Dugar,Mohitvishnu S. Gadde,Jonah Siekmann,Yesh Godse,Aayam Shrestha,Alan Fern*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的人形机器人SE(2)目标位姿直接优化方法，通过新的星座式奖励函数实现高效短距离运动


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法主要优化速度跟踪而非直接位姿到达，导致短距离任务效率低下，需要开发专门针对SE(2)目标的高效运动方法

Method: 开发强化学习方法，设计星座式奖励函数来鼓励自然高效的目标导向运动，并建立包含能耗、到达时间和步数的基准测试框架

Result: 该方法在性能上持续优于标准方法，成功实现从仿真到硬件的迁移，证明了针对性奖励设计对实用短距离人形运动的重要性

Conclusion: 通过专门设计的奖励函数直接优化SE(2)目标位姿，能够实现更高效、自然的人形机器人短距离运动，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

### [3] [Task and Motion Planning for Humanoid Loco-manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14099)
*Michal Ciebielski,Victor Dhédin,Majid Khadiv*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于接触模态的优化方法，统一计划人形机器人的移动和操作任务，包含全身动力学和约束


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人在长序列复杂任务中的运动和操作一体化规划问题，通过共享接触模式表征统一高级计划与低级运动

Method: 将符号动作定义为接触模式变化，通过优化基础框架进行任务、接触和运动计划的统一搜索，包含全身动力学和所有约束

Result: 在人形机器人平台上能够生成广泛范围的物理一致的运动-操作行为，处理长动作序列和复杂推理

Conclusion: 这是首个能够解决人形机器人运动-操作问题的完全无环计划集成方法，包含全身动力学和驱动约束

Abstract: This work presents an optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP)
framework that unifies planning for locomotion and manipulation through a
shared representation of contact modes. We define symbolic actions as contact
mode changes, grounding high-level planning in low-level motion. This enables a
unified search that spans task, contact, and motion planning while
incorporating whole-body dynamics, as well as all constraints between the
robot, the manipulated object, and the environment. Results on a humanoid
platform show that our method can generate a broad range of physically
consistent loco-manipulation behaviors over long action sequences requiring
complex reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
enables the resolution of an integrated TAMP formulation with fully acyclic
planning and whole body dynamics with actuation constraints for the humanoid
loco-manipulation problem.

### [4] [Domain Translation of a Soft Robotic Arm using Conditional Cycle Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14100)
*Nilay Kushawaha,Carlo Alessi,Lorenzo Fruzzetti,Egidio Falotico*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于条件循环生成对抗网络(CCGAN)的域转换框架，解决软机器人因材料退化导致的跨域知识迁移问题，实现从标准仿真环境到高粘度环境的控制器适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软机器人材料会随时间逐渐退化，传统分析方法需要精确的物理特性知识，而深度学习模型在不同物理属性的域之间无法直接迁移，需要解决跨域知识转移的挑战。

Method: 使用条件循环生成对抗网络(CCGAN)，通过动态学习方法，基于输入压力信号和对应的末端执行器位置/方向条件，将标准仿真环境训练的位姿控制器适配到粘度增加十倍的域。

Result: 在五种不同形状的轨迹跟踪实验中验证了方法的有效性，并在噪声扰动和周期性测试中表现出良好的鲁棒性，CCGAN-GP成功实现了跨域技能迁移。

Conclusion: CCGAN-GP框架有效促进了软机器人控制器的跨域知识迁移，为开发更具适应性和泛化能力的软机器人控制器开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

### [5] [Lightweight Tracking Control for Computationally Constrained Aerial Systems with the Newton-Raphson Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14185)
*Evanns Morales-Cuadrado,Luke Baird,Yorai Wardi,Samuel Coogan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文研究基于牛顿-拉弗森流方法的轻量级跟踪控制器在小型飞艇和中型四旋翼上的实际性能，与反馈线性化和非线性模型预测控制等传统方法相比，在保持相当或更好跟踪性能的同时显著降低了计算时间和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 采用基于牛顿-拉弗森流方法的轻量级跟踪控制器，在小型飞艇和中型四旋翼上进行真实飞行实验，与反馈线性化（飞艇）和非线性模型预测控制（两者）进行对比分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，牛顿-拉弗森流跟踪控制器在飞行轨迹均方根误差方面达到相当或优于基线方法的性能，同时计算时间显著减少，控制算法的CPU能耗大幅降低。

Conclusion: 牛顿-拉弗森流跟踪控制器在实际空中机器人应用中具有显著优势，能够在保持良好跟踪性能的同时大幅降低计算资源消耗，适合资源受限的机载应用场景。

Abstract: We investigate the performance of a lightweight tracking controller, based on
a flow version of the Newton-Raphson method, applied to a miniature blimp and a
mid-size quadrotor. This tracking technique has been shown to enjoy theoretical
guarantees of performance and has been applied with success in simulation
studies and on mobile robots with simple motion models. This paper investigates
the technique through real-world flight experiments on aerial hardware
platforms subject to realistic deployment and onboard computational
constraints. The technique's performance is assessed in comparison with the
established control frameworks of feedback linearization for the blimp, and
nonlinear model predictive control for both quadrotor and blimp. The
performance metrics under consideration are (i) root mean square error of
flight trajectories with respect to target trajectories, (ii) algorithms'
computation times, and (iii) CPU energy consumption associated with the control
algorithms. The experimental findings show that the Newton-Raphson flow-based
tracking controller achieves comparable or superior tracking performance to the
baseline methods with substantially reduced computation time and energy
expenditure.

### [6] [Efficient Environment Design for Multi-Robot Navigation via Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14105)
*Jahid Chowdhury Choton,John Woods,William Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效可定制的多机器人导航环境，将连续控制的多机器人导航任务建模为MDP，使用多种RL方法进行测试，并在3D农业场景中验证了实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人在连续状态和动作空间中导航的挑战，现有RL方法样本效率低、训练时间长且缺乏形式化保证，需要开发适用于真实世界的MDP环境。

Method: 将多机器人导航任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)，设计了多种环境变体，使用A2C、PPO、TRPO、TQC、CrossQ和ARS等梯度/非梯度RL方法进行性能评估，并在CoppeliaSim机器人模拟器中部署到3D农业场景进行验证。

Result: 开发了高效可定制的多机器人导航环境，能够使用有限资源和合理时间范围内解决真实世界系统问题，通过模拟器验证了学习模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究人员提供了开发适用于真实世界系统的MDP环境指南，并展示了如何使用现有最先进RL方法在有限资源下有效解决多机器人导航问题。

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation and path planning in continuous state and action
spaces with uncertain environments remains an open challenge. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving
this task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample
inefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL
for multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the
environment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable
environment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots
must visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths.
The task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe
the multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to
finding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the
environment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient
based RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world
applicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with
uncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness
by running inference on the learned models. We believe our work will guide the
researchers on how to develop MDP-based environments that are applicable to
real-world systems and solve them using the existing state-of-the-art RL
methods with limited resources and within reasonable time periods.

### [7] [SimGenHOI: Physically Realistic Whole-Body Humanoid-Object Interaction via Generative Modeling and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14120)
*Yuhang Lin,Yijia Xie,Jiahong Xie,Yuehao Huang,Ruoyu Wang,Jiajun Lv,Yukai Ma,Xingxing Zuo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimGenHOI是一个结合生成建模和强化学习的统一框架，用于生成可控且物理合理的人形机器人-物体交互动作，通过扩散变换器预测关键动作，并通过接触感知的全身控制策略确保物理真实性。


<details>

Conclusion: SimGenHOI框架成功解决了人形机器人-物体交互生成中的物理真实性问题，通过生成模型和强化学习的结合实现了可控且物理合理的动作生成。

Abstract: Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as
diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible
contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance
on our project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/simgen_hoi.

### [8] [SLAM-based Safe Indoor Exploration Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14235)
*Omar Mostafa,Nikolaos Evangeliou,Anthony Tzes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向平面障碍物环境的2D探索策略，使用双轮差速驱动系统进行空间探索，采用安全骨架方法保持与障碍物的最大距离，优先考虑机器人安全性和未探测空间的探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统圆形足迹机器人无法瞬时调整位姿的特点，在障碍物密集的平面空间中实现安全有效的探索，优先保障机器人安全同时最大化探索效率。

Method: 使用配备IMU、3D-LiDAR和RGB-D相机的双轮差速驱动系统，通过RTAB-SLAM进行定位建图，采用安全骨架探索策略使机器人始终与静态障碍物保持最大距离，朝向空间开口方向前进。

Result: 实验研究表明该路径规划策略能够有效探索空间，在ROS平台上实现了安全的空间探索，成功避免了障碍物并完成了未探测区域的探索任务。

Conclusion: 提出的安全骨架探索策略在保证机器人安全的前提下，能够有效指导机器人在障碍物密集环境中进行空间探索，为类似应用场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper suggests a 2D exploration strategy for a planar space cluttered
with obstacles. Rather than using point robots capable of adjusting their
position and altitude instantly, this research is tailored to classical agents
with circular footprints that cannot control instantly their pose. Inhere, a
self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system is used to explore the
place. The system is equipped with linear accelerometers and angular
gyroscopes, a 3D-LiDAR, and a forward-facing RGB-D camera. The system performs
RTAB-SLAM using the IMU and the LiDAR, while the camera is used for loop
closures. The mobile agent explores the planar space using a safe skeleton
approach that places the agent as far as possible from the static obstacles.
During the exploration strategy, the heading is towards any offered openings of
the space. This space exploration strategy has as its highest priority the
agent's safety in avoiding the obstacles followed by the exploration of
undetected space. Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent are
presented indicating the path planning strategy while exploring the space.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究从蜥蜴等动物的空中翻正反射中提取运动轨迹，通过多目标优化分析关键行为目标，并将其应用于空间机械臂系统的控制，为空间机器人提供可解释的自适应控制策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间机械臂系统在微重力环境下的控制面临巨大挑战，主要由于机械臂与航天器基座之间的动态耦合。研究探索利用生物灵感来解决这一问题。

Method: 从高速视频记录中提取动物的空中翻正运动轨迹，使用多目标优化框架分析关键行为目标，将得到的运动剖面作为参考轨迹用于空间机械臂控制。

Conclusion: 生物启发方法为空间机器人控制提供了新的解决方案，从动物行为中提取的运动轨迹能够有效改善空间机械臂系统的控制性能。

Abstract: Robotic arms mounted on spacecraft, known as space manipulator systems
(SMSs), are critical for enabling on-orbit assembly, satellite servicing, and
debris removal. However, controlling these systems in microgravity remains a
significant challenge due to the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and
the spacecraft base. This study explores the potential of using biological
inspiration to address this issue, focusing on animals, particularly lizards,
that exhibit mid-air righting reflexes. Based on similarities between SMSs and
these animals in terms of behavior, morphology, and environment, their
air-righting motion trajectories are extracted from high-speed video recordings
using computer vision techniques. These trajectories are analyzed within a
multi-objective optimization framework to identify the key behavioral goals and
assess their relative importance. The resulting motion profiles are then
applied as reference trajectories for SMS control, with baseline controllers
used to track them. The findings provide a step toward translating evolved
animal behaviors into interpretable, adaptive control strategies for space
robotics, with implications for improving maneuverability and robustness in
future missions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 一种增强LiDAR-惯性量程框架，通过适应性离群容容和扫描到子地图注册策略，解决LiDAR特征退化问题，提升定位精度和稳健性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-惯性量程(LIO)在复杂环境中对准确定位致关重要，但LiDAR特征退化问题严重影响状态估计的可靠性

Method: 提出适应性离群移除阈值机制，根据点到传感器距离和平台运动幅度动态调整；综合IMU数据的灵活扫描到子地图注册方法；设计新题杂杂权重矩阵，融合IMU预积分协方差和退化指标

Result: 在室内外各种特征稀疏或退化的环境中进行大量实验，证明方法在稳健性和精度方面均超过现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该增强LIO框架有效解决了LiDAR特征退化挑战，通过适应性离群处理、扫描到子地图注册和权重融合策略，显著提升了定位性能在复杂环境中的表现

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) plays a vital role in achieving accurate
localization and mapping, especially in complex environments. However, the
presence of LiDAR feature degeneracy poses a major challenge to reliable state
estimation. To overcome this issue, we propose an enhanced LIO framework that
integrates adaptive outlier-tolerant correspondence with a scan-to-submap
registration strategy. The core contribution lies in an adaptive outlier
removal threshold, which dynamically adjusts based on point-to-sensor distance
and the motion amplitude of platform. This mechanism improves the robustness of
feature matching in varying conditions. Moreover, we introduce a flexible
scan-to-submap registration method that leverages IMU data to refine pose
estimation, particularly in degenerate geometric configurations. To further
enhance localization accuracy, we design a novel weighting matrix that fuses
IMU preintegration covariance with a degeneration metric derived from the
scan-to-submap process. Extensive experiments conducted in both indoor and
outdoor environments-characterized by sparse or degenerate features-demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms
of both robustness and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出DTWIL方法解决动作受限模仿学习问题，通过轨迹对齐生成替代数据集，在多个机器人控制任务中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人控制和资源分配中，动作约束对于确保安全行为至关重要，但动作受限的学习者从动作空间更大的专家学习时存在占用度量不匹配的问题

Method: 使用动态时间规整距离和模型预测控制进行轨迹对齐，生成遵循类似状态轨迹但符合动作约束的替代数据集

Conclusion: DTWIL通过有效的轨迹对齐方法成功解决了动作受限模仿学习中的占用度量不匹配问题，为安全机器人控制提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring
safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications.
In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained
Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/NYCU-RL-Bandits-Lab/ACRL-Baselines.

*Nicole Fronda,Phil Smith,Bardh Hoxha,Yash Pant,Houssam Abbas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fair-CoPlan是一个半分布式的无人机路径规划系统，通过协商机制在保证安全的前提下公平分配飞行路径长度，避免某些无人机获得不成比例的短路径而牺牲其他无人机的利益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市空中交通(UAM)中不同运营商的无人机需要共享空域，但现有路径规划器可能导致某些无人机获得不公平的短路径，而其他无人机被迫接受长路径，这会影响运营商参与UAM的积极性。

Method: 提出三阶段协商式路径规划方法：1)服务提供商基于停机坪容量约束起降选择；2)运营商在约束下独立规划；3)服务提供商解决路径冲突，优化路径长度公平性。

Result: 仿真实验表明，相比非公平规划器，Fair-CoPlan能够产生更公平的结果，虽然会带来轻微延迟，但实现了公平性和效率的平衡。

Conclusion: Fair-CoPlan通过公平分摊冲突解决成本，能够促进更广泛的UAM参与，确保空域安全，并提供更大的运营商灵活性，为城市空中交通的可持续发展提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging transportation paradigm in which
Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) autonomously transport passengers and goods in
cities. The UAS have different operators with different, sometimes competing
goals, yet must share the airspace. We propose a negotiated, semi-distributed
flight planner that optimizes UAS' flight lengths {\em in a fair manner}.
Current flight planners might result in some UAS being given disproportionately
shorter flight paths at the expense of others. We introduce Fair-CoPlan, a
planner in which operators and a Provider of Service to the UAM (PSU) together
compute \emph{fair} flight paths. Fair-CoPlan has three steps: First, the PSU
constrains take-off and landing choices for flights based on capacity at and
around vertiports. Then, operators plan independently under these constraints.
Finally, the PSU resolves any conflicting paths, optimizing for path length
fairness. By fairly spreading the cost of deconfliction Fair-CoPlan encourages
wider participation in UAM, ensures safety of the airspace and the areas below
it, and promotes greater operator flexibility. We demonstrate Fair-CoPlan
through simulation experiments and find fairer outcomes than a non-fair planner
with minor delays as a trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当机器人存在竞争利益时，需要优化资源使用的公平性，特别是能量消耗的公平分配，同时保持任务成功

Method: 制定分布式公平运动规划器并与安全控制器集成，形成FiReFly算法

Result: 在模拟避障任务中，FiReFly比非公平规划器产生更公平的轨迹并提高任务成功率；实时性能可达15架无人机，扩展到50架无人机需要在运行时间和公平性改进之间权衡

Conclusion: FiReFly算法成功实现了多机器人运动规划中的公平性优化，在保证任务成功的同时改善了能量消耗的公平分配，具有良好的可扩展性

Abstract: We propose injecting notions of fairness into multi-robot motion planning.
When robots have competing interests, it is important to optimize for some kind
of fairness in their usage of resources. In this work, we explore how the
robots' energy expenditures might be fairly distributed among them, while
maintaining mission success. We formulate a distributed fair motion planner and
integrate it with safe controllers in a algorithm called FiReFly. For simulated
reach-avoid missions, FiReFly produces fairer trajectories and improves mission
success rates over a non-fair planner. We find that real-time performance is
achievable up to 15 UAVs, and that scaling up to 50 UAVs is possible with
trade-offs between runtime and fairness improvements.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 通过引入从动态分解中学习的预训练阶段，利用任意非专家数据学习动态表示，显著提升有限专家数据下的离线模仿学习性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限数据已成为扩展离线模仿学习的主要瓶颈，需要解决专家数据稀缺的问题

Method: 提出预训练阶段学习动态表示，使用噪声对比估计的损失函数，从任意具有相同动态的数据中学习表示

Result: 在MuJoCo上仅需单条轨迹即可模仿专家策略，在真实四足机器人上可利用模拟器预训练表示从少量真实演示中学习行走

Conclusion: 动态表示预训练能有效缓解离线模仿学习中的数据限制问题，实现从有限专家数据中高效学习

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to

Abstract: Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments
faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected
during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model
(LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on
one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic
adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the
processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM)
for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i)
a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks
specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an
online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and
explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an
optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via
search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop
verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both
subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected
online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning
capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods,
simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and
explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances,
with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks
completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during
adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵巧手内操作由于复杂的接触动力学和部分可观测性而具有挑战性。人类能够协同使用视觉和触觉，但机器人方法往往只优先考虑一种模态，限制了适应性

Method: 提出Flow Before Imitation (FBI)框架，通过基于动力学的潜在模型建立触觉信号与物体运动之间的因果关系。使用基于transformer的交互模块将流动衍生的触觉特征与视觉输入融合，训练一步扩散策略进行实时执行

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的两个定制手内操作任务和三个标准灵巧操作任务中，该方法均优于基线方法

Conclusion: FBI通过动态融合视觉和触觉信息，有效解决了灵巧手内操作的挑战，在多个任务中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation is a long-standing challenge in robotics due
to complex contact dynamics and partial observability. While humans synergize
vision and touch for such tasks, robotic approaches often prioritize one
modality, therefore limiting adaptability. This paper introduces Flow Before
Imitation (FBI), a visuotactile imitation learning framework that dynamically
fuses tactile interactions with visual observations through motion dynamics.
Unlike prior static fusion methods, FBI establishes a causal link between
tactile signals and object motion via a dynamics-aware latent model. FBI
employs a transformer-based interaction module to fuse flow-derived tactile
features with visual inputs, training a one-step diffusion policy for real-time
execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms the baseline methods in both simulation and the real world on two
customized in-hand manipulation tasks and three standard dexterous manipulation
tasks. Code, models, and more results are available in the website

Abstract: This technical report presents the champion solution of the Table Service
Track in the ICRA 2025 What Bimanuals Can Do (WBCD) competition. We tackled a
series of demanding tasks under strict requirements for speed, precision, and
reliability: unfolding a tablecloth (deformable-object manipulation), placing a
pizza onto the table (pick-and-place), and opening and closing a food container
with the lid. Our solution combines VR-based teleoperation and Learning from
Demonstrations (LfD) to balance robustness and autonomy. Most subtasks were
executed through high-fidelity remote teleoperation, while the pizza placement
was handled by an ACT-based policy trained from 100 in-person teleoperated
demonstrations with randomized initial configurations. By carefully integrating
scoring rules, task characteristics, and current technical capabilities, our
approach achieved both high efficiency and reliability, ultimately securing the
first place in the competition.

Abstract: To address the challenges of localization drift and perception-planning
coupling in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in open-top scenarios
(e.g., collapsed buildings, roofless mazes), this paper proposes EAROL, a novel
framework with a downward-mounted tilted LiDAR configuration (20{\deg}

environment, balancing environmental exploration, target tracking precision,
and energy efficiency. Physical experiments demonstrate 81% tracking error
reduction, 22% improvement in perceptual coverage, and near-zero vertical drift
across indoor maze and 60-meter-scale outdoor scenarios. This work proposes a
hardware-algorithm co-design paradigm, offering a robust solution for UAV
autonomy in post-disaster search and rescue missions. We will release our

Conclusion: TRUST-Planner通过拓扑引导的分层规划有效解决了复杂动态环境中的局部最小值和死锁问题，实现了高效可靠的自主飞行器运动规划。

Abstract: Despite extensive developments in motion planning of autonomous aerial
vehicles (AAVs), existing frameworks faces the challenges of local minima and
deadlock in complex dynamic environments, leading to increased collision risks.
To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided
hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance.
In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is
proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend
utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and
dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance
and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch
trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal
topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical
information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that
TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate
and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments.
Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the
proposed method.

Conclusion: 该研究为未来基准测试和架构改进提供了新的见解，有助于提升LLM在多智能体协作中的表现

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and
architectural improvements.

Abstract: Mobile robot platforms are increasingly being used to automate information
gathering tasks such as environmental monitoring. Efficient target tracking in
dynamic environments is critical for applications such as search and rescue and
pollutant cleanups. In this letter, we study active mapping of floating targets
that drift due to environmental disturbances such as wind and currents. This is
a challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal
variations in the map due to changing conditions. We propose an informative
path planning framework to map an arbitrary number of moving targets with
initially unknown positions in dynamic environments. A key component of our
approach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position
distributions over time. We propose an adaptive planning objective for target
tracking that leverages these predictions. Simulation experiments show that our
proposed planning objective improves target tracking performance compared to
existing methods that consider only entropy reduction as the planning
objective. Finally, we validate our approach in field tests using an autonomous
surface vehicle, showcasing its ability to track targets in real-world
monitoring scenarios.

Abstract: Aiming to enhance the consistency and thus long-term accuracy of Extended
Kalman Filters for terrestrial vehicle localization, this paper introduces the
Manifold Error State Extended Kalman Filter (M-ESEKF). By representing the
robot's pose in a space with reduced dimensionality, the approach ensures
feasible estimates on generic smooth surfaces, without introducing artificial
constraints or simplifications that may degrade a filter's performance. The
accompanying measurement models are compatible with common loosely- and
tightly-coupled sensor modalities and also implicitly account for the ground
geometry. We extend the formulation by introducing a novel correction scheme
that embeds additional domain knowledge into the sensor data, giving more
accurate uncertainty approximations and further enhancing filter consistency.
The proposed estimator is seamlessly integrated into a validated modular state
estimation framework, demonstrating compatibility with existing
implementations. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations across diverse scenarios and
dynamic sensor configurations show that the M-ESEKF outperforms classical
filter formulations in terms of consistency and stability. Moreover, it
eliminates the need for scenario-specific parameter tuning, enabling its
application in a variety of real-world settings.

Abstract: Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated
technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and
enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly
specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers
to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to
develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform
multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry
experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these
collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to
ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand
what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a
safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.
For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors
nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human
comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an
instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact
between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce
a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an
LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we
design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the
human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure
safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's
actions which we validate through a user study.
